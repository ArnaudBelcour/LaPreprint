  abstract = {Quiescence (death feigning) was induced in the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata by mechanical disturbance of live and artificial plants on which beetles were walking, feeding or grooming. The response consisted of a sudden cessation of activity lasting 12 to 500 s. Recovery from this immobile state was usually preceded by either antennal or leg movement. The time taken for beetles to come out of the immobile state (i.e. recovery time) was not dependent on age or sex of beetles or on stimulus duration, but was dependent on degree of displacement and on satiation level. Repeated stimulations led to longer recovery times and to a smaller proportion of responding beetles. Stimulation within the immobile state also prolonged recovery time. The most effective frequency of mechanical disturbance for startling beetles was 30 Hz. This response is presumed to be part of the extensive defense repertoire of this beetle, but we have so far been unable to discover a natural enemy that will elicit it.},

  abstract = {Many of the deleterious effects of chronic stress in vertebrates are caused by the long-term elevation of stress hormones. These negative effects are thought to be unavoidable by-products of sustained activation of the stress response, but the details remain unclear. A comparative perspective may help in understanding chronic stress. We exposed crickets (Gryllus texensis) to a mock predator. A single exposure to a mock predator induced a transient increase in the hemolymph (blood) concentration of the insect stress neurohormone, octopamine. Repeated exposure to the mock predator increased basal levels of octopamine, similar to the effects of chronic stress on the basal levels of vertebrate stress hormones. This study is the first to report an increase in the basal levels of an invertebrate stress hormone in response to repeated flight-or-fight stress. Chronic stress reduced weight gain, and decreased feeding and enhanced weight loss after food deprivation in adult female crickets. However, chronic stress also increased the tendency of crickets to produce sustained flight. Therefore, this study supports the hypothesis that increasing basal levels of stress hormones may be a phylogenetically common response to chronically stressful conditions. It also demonstrates that chronic stress has both positive and negative effects in insects.},

Light intensity gets progressively weaker with increasing depth and internal tides or inertial currents may be the only remaining zeitgebers regulating biorhythms in deep-sea decapods. Benthopelagic coupling, exemplified by vertically moving shrimps within the water column, may also act as a source of indirect synchronisation to the day-night cycle for species living in permanently dark areas. At the same time, seasonal rhythms in growth and reproduction may be an exogenous response to spring-summer changes in upper layer productivity (via phytoplankton) or, alternatively, may be provoked by the synchronisation mediated by an endogenous controlling mechanism (via melatonin). In our review, we will focus on the behavioural rhythms of crustacean decapods inhabiting depths where the sun light is absent. Potential scenarios for future research on deep-sea decapod behaviour are suggested by new in situ observation technologies.

This global increase with walking was particularly strong in dopamine neurons. Second, we extracted maps of spatially distinct sources of activity as well as their time series using principal component analysis and independent component analysis. The characteristic shapes in the maps matched the anatomy of subneuropil regions and, in some cases, a specific neuron type. Brain structures that responded to light and odor were consistent with previous reports, confirming the new technique's validity.

  abstract = {Sleep is an evolutionarily conserved process that has been described in different animal systems. For insects, sleep characterization has been primarily achieved using behavioral and electrophysiological correlates in a few systems. Sleep in mosquitoes, which are important vectors of disease-causing pathogens, has not been directly examined. This is surprising as circadian rhythms, which have been well studied in mosquitoes, influence sleep in other systems. In this study, we characterized sleep in mosquitoes using body posture analysis and behavioral correlates, and quantified the effect of sleep deprivation on sleep rebound, host landing and blood-feeding propensity. Body and appendage position metrics revealed a clear distinction between the posture of mosquitoes in their putative sleep and awake states for multiple species, which correlated with a reduction in responsiveness to host cues. Sleep assessment informed by these posture analyses indicated significantly more sleep during periods of low activity. Night-time and daytime sleep deprivation resulting from the delivery of vibration stimuli induced sleep rebound in the subsequent phase in day and night active mosquitoes, respectively. Lastly, sleep deprivation suppressed host landing in both laboratory and field settings, and impaired blood feeding of a human host when mosquitoes would normally be active. These results suggest that quantifiable sleep states occur in mosquitoes and highlight the potential epidemiological importance of mosquito sleep.},

Nine well-trained athletes at high national competition level within sprinting and jumping disciplines participated in the study. The training was supervised and augmented feedback on performance was used to ensure maximal training intensity. The drop jumps were performed with minimal contact time and maximal jumping height. Assessment of performance during training showed effects of motor learning. Before and after the training intervention maximal isometric muscle strength, the biomechanics, muscle activity pattern of the lower extremities and the soleus H-reflex and V-wave during drop jumping were measured. Maximal jump height and performance index (PI) defined as jumping height divided by contact time improved significantly by 11.9\% (P = 0.024) and 16.2\% (P = 0.009), respectively. Combined ankle and knee joint peak power was significantly increased by 7\% after training (P = 0.047). The preactivity in the soleus muscle decreased 16\% (P = 0.015). The soleus H-reflex was unchanged after training, while the soleus V-wave increased significantly at 45 msec after touchdown. This may indicate an increased drive to the a-motor neuron pool following training. Muscle strength parameters were unaffected by the training. The results demonstrate that 4 weeks of intensive drop jump training can improve jumping performance also in well-trained athletes without concomitant changes in muscle strength. It is suggested that the behavioral improvement is primarily due to neural factors regulating the activation pattern controlling the drop jump movement.},

This study investigated which technique is more beneficial in each phase using computer simulation. Kinematic data were obtained from an entire triple jump using a Vicon automatic motion capture system. A planar 13-segment torque-driven subject-specific computer simulation model was evaluated by varying torque generator activation timings using a genetic algorithm in order to match performance data. The matching produced a close agreement between simulation and performance, with differences of 3.8\%, 2.7\%, and 3.1\% for the hop, step, and jump phases, respectively. Each phase was optimised for jump distance and an increase in jump distance beyond the matched simulations of 3.3\%, 11.1\%, and 8.2\% was obtained for the hop, step, and jump, respectively. The optimised technique used symmetrical shoulder flexion whereas the triple jumper had used an asymmetrical arm technique. This arm action put the leg extensors into slower concentric conditions allowing greater extensor torques to be produced. The main increases in work came at the joints of the stance leg but the largest increases in angular impulse came at the shoulder joints, indicating the importance of both measures when assessing the impact of individual joint actions on changes in technique. Possible benefits of the double-arm technique include: cushioning the stance leg during impact; raising the centre of mass of the body at takeoff; facilitating an increase in kinetic energy at takeoff; allowing a re-orientation of the body during flight. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

This study used computer simulation to investigate the effects of constraining the takeoff velocities in the hop phase on the velocity trade-offs in this and subsequent phases. Kinematic data were obtained from an entire triple jump using a Vicon automatic motion capture system, and strength and anthropometric data were collected from the triple jumper.

The results showed that the loss in horizontal velocity during each contact phase was strongly related to the vertical takeoff velocity (R2=0.83) in that phase rather than the overall gain in vertical velocity as found in previous studies. Maximum overall distances were achieved with step phases which were 30\% of the total distance of the triple jump confirming the results of experimental studies on elite triple jumpers. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

This study used a planar whole body torque-driven computer simulation model of the ground contact parts of all three phases of the triple jump to investigate the effect of strength and approach velocity on optimal performance. The strength and approach velocity of the simulation model were each increased by up to 30\% in 10\% increments from baseline data collected from a national standard triple jumper. Increasing strength always resulted in an increased overall jump distance. Increasing approach velocity also typically resulted in an increased overall jump distance but there was a point past which increasing approach velocity without increasing strength did not lead to an increase in overall jump distance. Increasing both strength and approach velocity by 10\%, 20\%, and 30\% led to roughly equivalent increases in overall jump distances. Distances ranged from 14.05~m with baseline strength and approach velocity, up to 18.49~m with 30\% increases in both. Optimal phase ratios were either hop-dominated or balanced, and typically became more balanced when the strength of the model was increased by a greater percentage than its approach velocity. The range of triple jump distances that resulted from the optimisation process suggests that strength and approach velocity are of great importance for triple jump performance.},

Hop-dominated techniques are associated with higher forces than jump-dominated techniques; therefore optimal phase ratio may be related to a combination of strength and approach velocity.},

  abstract = {Animals react to environmental changes over timescales ranging from seconds to days and weeks. An important question is how sensory stimuli are parsed into neural signals operating over such diverse temporal scales. Here, we uncover a specialized circuit, from sensory neurons to higher brain centers, that processes information about long-lasting, absolute cold temperature in Drosophila. We identify second-order thermosensory projection neurons (TPN-IIs) exhibiting sustained firing that scales with absolute temperature. Strikingly, this activity only appears below the species-specific, preferred temperature for D.~melanogaster ({$\sim$}25\textdegree C). We trace the inputs and outputs of TPN-IIs and find that they are embedded in a cold ``thermometer'' circuit that provides powerful and persistent inhibition to brain centers involved in regulating sleep and activity. Our results demonstrate that the fly nervous system selectively encodes and relays absolute temperature information and illustrate a sensory mechanism that allows animals to adapt behavior specifically to cold conditions on the timescale of hours to days.},

Yet, the persistence of sleep despite evolutionary pressures, and the deleterious effects of sleep deprivation, indicate that sleep serves a function or functions that cannot easily be bypassed. Recent research demonstrates sleep to be phylogenetically far more pervasive than previously appreciated; it is possible that the very first animals slept. Here, we give an overview of sleep across various species, with the aim of determining its original purpose. Sleep exists in animals without cephalized nervous systems and can be influenced by non-neuronal signals, including those associated with metabolic rhythms. Together, these observations support the notion that sleep serves metabolic functions in neural and non-neural tissues.},

This question of causation is most directly addressable in genetically tractable model organisms, including invertebrates such as Drosophila. Yet there is ongoing debate about whether such species even have ``emotions,'' as emotions are typically defined with reference to human behavior and neuroanatomy. Here, we argue that emotional behaviors are a class of behaviors that express internal emotion states. These emotion states exhibit certain general functional and adaptive properties that apply across any specific human emotions like fear or anger, as well as across phylogeny. These general properties, which can be thought of as ``emotion primitives,'' can be modeled and studied in evolutionarily distant model organisms, allowing functional dissection of their mechanistic bases and tests of their causal relationships to behavior. More generally, our approach not only aims at better integration of such studies in model organisms with studies of emotion in humans, but also suggests a revision of how emotion should be operationalized within psychology and psychiatry.},

Rodents can navigate a virtual environment by running on a spherical treadmill, but simulating locomotion in this way can both bias and suppress the frequency of their behaviors as well as introduce vestibulomotor and vestibulovisual sensory conflict during locomotion. Updating the virtual environment via the subject's own freely-moving head movements solves both the naturalistic behavior bias and vestibular conflict issues.  In this thesis, I review elements of self-motion and 3D scene perception that contribute to a sense of immersion in virtual environments and suggest a freely-moving CAVE system as a VR solution for low-artifact neuroscience experiments.  The manuscripts describing the 3D graphics Python package and the virtual reality setup are included.  In this freely-moving CAVE VR setup, freely-moving rats demonstrate immersion in virtual environments by displaying height aversion to virtual cliffs, exploration preference of virtual objects, and spontaneously modify their locomotion trajectories near virtual walls. These experiments help bridge the classic behavior and virtual reality literature by showing that rats display similar behaviors to virtual environment features without training.},

Here, we developed a non-invasive preparation for structural and functional imaging of the fly brain through the intact head cuticle. We first showed that the head cuticle transmits long-wavelength laser light with surprisingly high efficiencies. In fact, the tissue that interferes with laser light during multiphoton imaging is the air sacs underneath the head cuticle. We developed a non-invasive imaging preparation that compresses the air sacs, and used it to image the mushroom body Kenyon cells and central complex ring neurons through the cuticle at cellular resolution using both 2-and 3-photon microscopy. We also performed non-invasive short-term and long-term functional imaging (for the first time for 12 consecutive hours) of odour-evoked calcium responses from the mushroom body Kenyon cells. Our results demonstrate that the non-invasive imaging preparation developed here extends the time limits of current in vivo imaging methods used in flies that require an invasive surgery, and opens up new ways to capture neural activity from the intact fly brain.}

This paper attempts to characterize one aspect of this ongoing activity by examining how the information content carried by specific neurons varies as a function of brain state. We recorded from rats chronically implanted with tetrodes in the primary visual cortex during awake and sleep periods. Electro-encephalogram and spike trains were recorded during 30-min periods, and 2-4 neuronal spikes were isolated per tetrode off-line. All the activity included in the analysis was spontaneous, being recorded from the visual cortex in the absence of visual stimuli. The brain state was determined through a combination of behavior evaluation, electroencephalogram and electromyogram analysis. Information in the spike trains was determined by using Lempel-Ziv Complexity. Complexity was used to estimate the entropy of neural discharges and thus the information content (Amig\'oet~al. Neural Comput., 2004, 16: 717-736). The information content in spike trains (range 4-70bitss-1) was evaluated during different brain states and particularly during the transition periods. Transitions toward states of deeper sleep coincided with a decrease of information, while transitions to the awake state resulted in an increase in information. Changes in both directions were of the same magnitude, about 30\%. Information in spike trains showed a high temporal correlation between neurons, reinforcing the idea of the impact of the brain state in the information content of spike trains. \textcopyright{} 2012 European Sleep Research Society.},

We implemented a VR setup for rats, including software and large-scale electrophysiology, that supports 2D navigation by allowing rotation and walking in any direction. The entorhinal-hippocampal circuit, including place, head direction, and grid cells, showed 2D activity patterns similar to those in the real world. Furthermore, border cells were observed, and hippocampal remapping was driven by environment shape, suggesting functional processing of virtual boundaries. These results illustrate that 2D spatial representations can be engaged by visual and rotational vestibular stimuli alone and suggest a novel VR tool for studying rat navigation.},

Spikeling is based on an Arduino microcontroller running the computationally efficient Izhikevich model of a spiking neuron. The microcontroller is connected to input ports that simulate synaptic excitation or inhibition, to dials controlling current injection and noise levels, to a photodiode that makes Spikeling light sensitive, and to a light-emitting diode (LED) and speaker that allows spikes to be seen and heard. Output ports provide access to variables such as membrane potential for recording in experiments or digital signals that can be used to excite other connected Spikelings. These features allow for the intuitive exploration of the function of neurons and networks mimicking electrophysiological experiments.

How well do the results from these studies reflect the natural behaviour of flying insects considering the radical differences in contrast, spatial composition, colour and dimensionality between these visual environments? Here, we aim to answer this question by investigating the effect of three- and two-dimensional naturalistic and artificial scenes on bumblebee flight control in an outdoor setting and compare the results with those of similar experiments performed in an indoor setting. In particular, we focus on investigating the effect of axial (front-to-back) visual motion cues on ground speed and centring behaviour. Our results suggest that, in general, ground speed control and centring behaviour in bumblebees is not affected by whether the visual scene is two- or three dimensional, naturalistic or artificial, or whether the experiment is conducted indoors or outdoors. The only effect that we observe between naturalistic and artificial scenes on flight control is that when the visual scene is three-dimensional and the visual information on the floor is minimised, bumblebees fly further from the midline of the tunnel. The findings presented here have implications not only for understanding the mechanisms of visual flight control in bumblebees, but also for the results of past and future investigations into visually guided flight control in other insects.},

However, the genomic basis of chemoreception in cave-dwelling fauna has been largely unexplored. We generated de novo transcriptomes for antennae and body samples of the troglobitic beetle Speonomus longicornis (whose characters suggest an extreme adaptation to a deep subterranean environment) in order to investigate the evolutionary origin and diversification of the chemosensory gene repertoire across coleopterans through a phylogenomic approach. Our results suggested a diminished diversity of odourant and gustatory gene repertoires compared to polyphagous beetles that inhabit surface habitats. Moreover, S. longicornis showed a large diversity of odourant-binding proteins, suggesting an important role of these proteins in capturing airborne chemical cues. We identified a gene duplication of the ionotropic coreceptor IR25a, a highly conserved single-copy gene in protostomes involved in thermal and humidity sensing. In addition, no homologous genes to sugar receptors or the ionotropic receptor IR41a were detected. Our findings suggest that the chemosensory gene repertoire of this cave beetle may result from adaptation to the highly specific ecological niche it occupies, and that gene duplication and loss may have played an important role in the evolution of gene families involved in chemoreception. Altogether, our results shed light on the genomic basis of chemoreception in a cave-dwelling invertebrate and pave the road towards understanding the genomic underpinnings of adaptation to the subterranean lifestyle at a deeper level.},

  abstract = {This book assembles recent research on memory and learning in plants. Organisms that share a capability to store information about experiences in the past have an actively generated background resource on which they can compare and evaluate coming experiences in order to react faster or even better. This is an essential tool for all adaptation purposes. Such memory/learning skills can be found from bacteria up to fungi, animals and plants, although until recently it had been mentioned only as capabilities of higher animals. With the rise of epigenetics the context dependent marking of experiences on the genetic level is an essential perspective to understand memory and learning in organisms. Plants are highly sensitive organisms that actively compete for environmental resources. They assess their surroundings, estimate how much energy they need for particular goals, and then realize the optimum variant. They take measures to control certain environmental resources. They perceive themselves and can distinguish between `self' and `non-self'. They process and evaluate information and then modify their behavior accordingly. The book will guide scientists in further investigations on these skills of plant behavior and on how plants mediate signaling processes between themselves and the environment in memory and learning processes.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Tracking small laboratory animals such as flies, fish, and worms is used for phenotyping in neuroscience, genetics, disease modelling, and drug discovery. Current imaging systems are limited either in spatial resolution or throughput. A system capable of imaging a large number of animals with sufficient resolution to estimate their pose would enable a new class of experiments where detailed behavioural differences are quantified but at a scale where hundreds of treatments can be tested simultaneously. Here we report a new imaging system consisting of an array of six 12-megapixel cameras that can simultaneously record from all the wells of a 96-well plate with a resolution of 80 pixels/mm at 25 frames per second. We show that this resolution is sufficient to estimate the pose of nematode worms including head identification and to extract high-dimensional phenotypic fingerprints. We illustrate the potential application of the system in three domains with a study of behavioural variability across wild isolates, experiments on the escape response and sensitisation of worms to repeated blue light stimulation, and the utility of this stimulus for phenotyping disease models. Because the system is compatible with standard multiwell plates, it makes computational ethological approaches accessible in existing high-throughput pipelines and greatly increases the scale of possible phenotypic screening experiments in \emph{C. elegans}.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Electrophysiological investigations of the mammalian hippocampus and associated brain structures have identified several classes of neurons which represent information about an organism's position and orientation. These include place cells, grid cells, head direction cells, and boundary vector cells, as well as cells representing aspects of self-motion. Understanding how these neural representations are formed and updated from environmental sensory information and from information relating to self-motion is an important topic attracting considerable current interest. Here we review the computational mechanisms thought to underlie the formation of these different spatial representations, the interactions between them, and their use in guiding behaviour. These include some of the clearest examples of computational mechanisms of general interest to neuroscience, such as attractor dynamics, temporal coding and multi-modal integration. We also discuss the close relationships between computational modelling and experimental research which are driving progress in this area. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.}

SOFT complements classic optimal foraging theory (OFT) in that it assumes fully uninformed searchers in an explicit space. Mathematically, the theory quantifies the time spent by a random walker (the forager) on a spatial region delimited by absorbing boundaries (the targets). The walker starts from a given initial position and has no previous knowledge (nor the possibility to gain knowledge) on target/patch locations. Averages on such process can describe the dynamics of an uninformed forager looking for successive targets in a diverse and dynamical spatial environment. The framework provides a means to advance in the study of search uncertainty and animal information use in natural foraging systems. \textcopyright{} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The research group was composed of 38 Turkish male triple jumpers. The findings were obtained during the official competitions. All trials of the athletes were recorded by two camcorders. The photocells which are used to determine running times of athletes have been established 1m, 6m and 11m distance from the take-off board. Velocities for 11m-6m section (V1), 6m-1m section (V2), total 10m (V10) and difference between V2 and V1 (V2-V1) were calculated for each jump. The official jump distances were recorded. Best performance of the athletes were analysed by the two dimensional analysis software. The official distance, actual distance, distance lost at take-off, hop distance, step distance, jump distance, hop percentage, jump percentage and step percentage, step length and velocity variables, contact time variables were measured and calculated. General characteristics of the participants were presented as means and standard deviations ({$\pm$}SD). Pearson correlation coefficients (r) were used to express the relationships between parameters. Linear regression analysis was used to find coefficients of determination (r2) for the relationships. Results. It was found relationships between horizontal velocity variables and jumping distance. A strong correlation is between V10 and official distance (r=0.88, p{$<$}0.05, r2=0.78). It was established a linear regression model to explain this relation [Predictive distance=(1.822*V10)-1.952]. Furthermore the technical effectiveness score can calculated with the measured distance divided by predictive distance during the competition or technical training. Conclusion. This study has demonstrated that the approach velocity is highly related to jumping performance in triple jump. It can be suggested that the speed ability should be priority testing in talent identification in triple jump. In addition, the effectiveness score which is explained in this study can use by the athletic coaches to assess of their athletes' technical level.},

In a Hodgkin-Huxley-type model of the AL, interactions between excitatory PNs and inhibitory local neurons (LNs) created coherent network oscillations during odor stimulation. GABAergic interconnections between LNs led to competition among them such that different groups of LNs oscillated with periodic Ca2+ spikes during different 50-250 ms temporal epochs, similar to those recorded in vivo. During these epochs, LN-evoked IPSPs caused phase-locked, population oscillations in sets of postsynaptic PNs. The model shows how alternations of the inhibitory drive can temporally encode sensory information in networks of neurons without precisely tuned intrinsic oscillatory properties.},

Ground beetles Pterostichus oblongopunctatus were reared at 10 or 20\textdegree C on control or Ni-contaminated (2500~mg Ni kg-1) food. After 64~days half of the Ni-exposed beetles were transferred to uncontaminated food (elimination phase). The remaining Ni-exposed beetles were left on the contaminated food to the end of the experiment (96~days). After completing the experiment, respiration rate and locomotor activity were measured in Ni-contaminated beetles (Ni), Ni-contaminated ones after elimination (E), and controls (C). Then, the beetles were analyzed for Ni body loads. The respiration rate, which was always measured at 20\textdegree C for all experimental groups, was highest in Ni beetles reared at 10\textdegree C and did not differ between groups C and E. Similarly, locomotor activity was highest in Ni beetles, and marginally significant temperature effect was found. The study indicated thus that exposure to elevated Ni concentrations increased the maintenance costs in P. oblongopunctatus and that rearing the beetles at suboptimal temperature increased the respiration rate even further. However, the effects observed in both respiration rate and locomotor activity were reversible after decontamination. The study demonstrated also the potential of MFB\textregistered{} for assessing the behavior of soil-dwelling organism in environmental toxicology.},

The circadian clock neuroanatomy in D. melanogaster is one of the best-known clock networks in insects and basic circadian behavior has been characterized in detail in this insect. Another model in chronobiology is the honey bee Apis mellifera, of which diurnal foraging behavior has been described already in the early twentieth century. A. mellifera hallmarks the research on the interplay between the clock and sociality and complex behaviors like sun compass navigation and time-place-learning. Nevertheless, there are aspects of clock structure and function, like for example the role of the clock in photoperiodism and diapause, which can be only insufficiently investigated in these two models. Unlike high-latitude flies such as Chymomyza costata or D. ezoana, cosmopolitan D. melanogaster flies do not display a photoperiodic diapause. Similarly, A. mellifera bees do not go into ``real'' diapause, but most solitary bee species exhibit an obligatory diapause. Furthermore, sociality evolved in different Hymenoptera independently, wherefore it might be misleading to study the social clock only in one social insect. Consequently, additional research on non-model insects is required to understand the circadian clock in Diptera and Hymenoptera. In this review, we introduce the two chronobiology model insects D. melanogaster and A. mellifera, compare them with other insects and show their advantages and limitations as general models for insect circadian clocks.},

Here, we take advantage of the large number of studies that have estimated the repeatability of various behaviours to evaluate whether there is good evidence for consistent individual differences in behaviour and to answer some outstanding questions about possible factors that can influence repeatability. Specifically, we use meta-analysis to ask whether different types of behaviours were more repeatable than others, and if repeatability estimates depended on taxa, sex, age, field versus laboratory, the number of measures and the interval between measures. Some of the overall patterns that were revealed by this analysis were that repeatability estimates were higher in the field compared to the laboratory and repeatability was higher when the interval between observations was short. Mate preference behaviour was one of the best studied but least repeatable behaviours. Our findings prompt new insights into the relative flexibility of different types of behaviour and offer suggestions for the design and analysis of future research.},

In free flight, visual expansion can evoke saccades, and saccade-like turns are triggered by similar stimuli in tethered flies. However, because the fictive turns in rigidly tethered flies follow a much longer time course, the extent to which these two behaviors share a common neural basis is unknown. A key difference between tethered and free flight conditions is the presence of additional sensory cues in the latter, which might serve to modify the time course of the saccade motor program. To study the role of sensory feedback in saccades, we have developed a new preparation in which a fly is tethered to a fine steel pin that is aligned within a vertically oriented magnetic field, allowing it to rotate freely around its yaw axis. In this experimental paradigm, flies perform rapid turns averaging 35 degrees in 80 ms, similar to the kinematics of free flight saccades. Our results indicate that tethered and free flight saccades share a common neural basis, but that the lack of appropriate feedback signals distorts the behavior performed by rigidly fixed flies. Using our new paradigm, we also investigated the features of visual stimuli that elicit saccades. Our data suggest that saccades are triggered when expanding objects reach a critical threshold size, but that their timing depends little on the precise time course of expansion. These results are consistent with expansion detection circuits studied in other insects, but do not exclude other models based on the integration of local movement detectors.},

It is first shown that intermittent search strategies are actually widely observed at various scales. At the macroscopic scale, this is, for example, the case of animals looking for food; at the microscopic scale, intermittent transport patterns are involved in a reaction pathway of DNA-binding proteins as well as in intracellular transport. Second, generic stochastic models are introduced, which show that intermittent strategies are efficient strategies that enable the minimization of search time. This suggests that the intrinsic efficiency of intermittent search strategies could justify their frequent observation in nature. Last, beyond these modeling aspects, it is proposed that intermittent strategies could also be used in a broader context to design and accelerate search processes. \textcopyright{} 2011 American Physical Society.}

  abstract = {Many animals regulate their activity over a 24-h sleep\textendash wake cycle, concentrating their peak periods of activity to coincide with the hours of daylight, darkness, or twilight, or using different periods of light and darkness in more complex ways. These behavioral differences, which are in themselves functional traits, are associated with suites of physiological and morphological adaptations with implications for the ecological roles of species. The biogeography of diel time partitioning is, however, poorly understood. Here, we document basic biogeographic patterns of time partitioning by mammals and ecologically relevant large-scale patterns of natural variation in ``illuminated activity time'' constrained by temperature, and we determine how well the first of these are predicted by the second. Although the majority of mammals are nocturnal, the distributions of diurnal and crepuscular species richness are strongly associated with the availability of biologically useful daylight and twilight, respectively. Cathemerality is associated with relatively long hours of daylight and twilight in the northern Holarctic region, whereas the proportion of nocturnal species is highest in arid regions and lowest at extreme high altitudes. Although thermal constraints on activity have been identified as key to the distributions of organisms, constraints due to functional adaptation to the light environment are less well studied. Global patterns in diversity are constrained by the availability of the temporal niche; disruption of these constraints by the spread of artificial lighting and anthropogenic climate change, and the potential effects on time partitioning, are likely to be critical influences on species' future distributions.},

  abstract = {In rodents, the alternation of light and dark is the main synchronizer of circadian rhythms. The entrainment abilities of the LD cycle could be estimated by experimental modifications of the photoperiod and by following the subsequent temporal distribution of a circadian rhythm. The rate of re-entrainment of a rhythm is determined by the nature of the studied variable, by the direction (advance or delay) and the magnitude (or value) of the phase shift. In rodents, core body temperature and motor activity are known to be well synchronized with each other under L:D 12:12 and under constant conditions (LL or DD). There are clear evidences that the circadian pattern of motor activity is generated by two oscillators, one from dusk signal and the other from dawn signal. Whether the circadian rhythms of body temperature and motor activity are generated by a common circadian mechanism or controlled by separate ones still remains unknown. The purpose of this review is to summarize the results obtained on the circadian rhythms of body temperature and motor activity throughout the daily cycle in order to clarify the relationships between these two functions.},

The aims of this study were (1) to test the hypothesis that using a short approach (6-8-10-12 strides) of increasing length, performance variables will be non-linearly related to distance jumped, (2) to investigate the nature of these relationships for a group of long jumpers and individuals within the group, and (3) to use the regression analysis to determine the optimum number of run-up strides and predict the jumping distance that would be achieved with an optimum length run-up for an individual jumper. Eight male long jumpers with different skill levels (body mass: 75.2{$\pm$}2.2 kg and body height: 188.0{$\pm$}4.2 cm) performed a series of short-approach maximal jumps and the full-length approach in a competition. Kinematic data were collected from video analysis. The relationship between the number of approach strides and velocity, and distance jumped were shown to be best represented by second order polynomial equations. When applied on an individual basis, the predicted jump distances (6.95{$\pm$}.61 m) agreed very well with those found in actual competition (6.96{$\pm$}.58m). As a result, these individual relationships were used to comment on individual optimal approach lengths and to evaluate an individual's potential for performance in the long jump event. It was concluded that the short approach model of performance is a valuable paradigm for investigating long jump behaviour and the performance potential of individuals. The findings also supported the simplified mathematical model proposed in the literature for the study of long jump performance.},

Both questions arose when I watched Noah Hutton's film, In Silico .* I invited several prominent scientists to comment on the film's main topic, modeling the human brain, in a special collection for eNeuro . The film tells the 10-year journey beginning with Henry Markram's 2009 TED talk (https://www.ted.com/talks/henry\textbackslash\_markram\textbackslash\_a\textbackslash\_brain\textbackslash\_in\textbackslash\_a\textbackslash\_supercomputer), where he announced that the brain could be modeled within 10\,years in a supercomputer. The scientific initiative began in 2005 at \'Ecole Polytechnique F\'ed\'erale de Lausanne when Markram founded and directed the first scientific initiative toward his goal: the Blue Brain Project (https://www.epfl.ch/research/domains/bluebrain/). Then, in 2012, the European Union selected the Human Brain Project (https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/en/), also then led by Markram, as one of two flagship programs to be awarded \texteuro 1 billion over 10\,years. Modeling the human brain was one objective (Destexhe, 2021). For a scientific and historical perspective on the Blue Brain Project and the Human Brain Project, you can refer to Yves Fr\'egnac's commentary (Fr\'egnac, 2021). As indicated by Eve Marder (Marder, 2021), one cannot but fall for the beauty of the brain. This happened to me when I saw a Golgi staining of a Purkinje cell during my first visit to a neuroscience lab. My first research project was on a computer model of the cerebellum. I then discovered the beast: by tweaking the model parameters, I could make it behave as I wished. Other commentaries (Jirsa, 2021; Marder, 2021) mention that because of degeneracy (there are multiple solutions to the same problem), and because many important parameters were omitted (Fairhall, 2021), the probability to construct a working brain via the inclusion of parameters measured from different animals would be close to \ldots},

Foragers were exposed to a forced navigation task in which they learned to home more efficiently from an unexpected release site by acquiring navigational memory during the successful homing flight. This task was quantified using harmonic radar tracking and applied to bees that were equipped with a radio frequency identification device (RFID). The RFID was used to record their outbound and inbound flights and continuously monitor their behavior inside the colony, including their rest during the day and sleep at night. Bees marked with the RFID behaved normally inside and outside the hive. Bees slept longer during the night following forced navigation tasks, but foraging flights of different lengths did not lead to different rest times during the day or total sleep time during the night. Sleep deprivation before the forced navigation task did not alter learning and memory acquired during the task. However, sleep deprivation during the night after forced navigation learning reduced the probability of returning successfully to the hive from the same release site. It is concluded that consolidation of novel navigation memory is facilitated by night sleep in bees. \textcopyright{} 2012. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.},

A planar seven-segment angle-driven model was developed and quantitatively evaluated based on the agreement of its output to empirical data from an international-level male sprinter (100~m personal best~=~10.28~s). The model was then applied to independently assess the effects of manipulating touchdown distance (horizontal distance between the foot and centre of mass) and range of ankle joint dorsiflexion during early stance on horizontal external power production during stance. The model matched the empirical data with a mean difference of 5.2\%. When the foot was placed progressively further forward at touchdown, horizontal power production continually reduced. When the foot was placed further back, power production initially increased (a peak increase of 0.7\% occurred at 0.02~m further back) but decreased as the foot continued to touchdown further back. When the range of dorsiflexion during early stance was reduced, exponential increases in performance were observed. Increasing negative touchdown distance directs the ground reaction force more horizontally; however, a limit to the associated performance benefit exists. Reducing dorsiflexion, which required achievable increases in the peak ankle plantar flexor moment, appears potentially beneficial for improving early acceleration performance.},

Despite their integration into open science practices, the providence and design of these digital tools are rarely explicitly scrutinized. This means that influential factors, such as the funding models of the parent organizations, their geographic location, and the dependency on digital infrastructures are rarely considered. Suggestions from literature and anecdotal evidence already draw attention to the impact of these factors, and raise the question of whether the open science ecosystem can realise the aspiration to become a truly ``unlimited digital commons'' in its current structure. Methods : In an online research approach, we compiled and analysed the geolocation, terms and conditions as well as funding models of 242 digital tools increasingly being used by researchers in various disciplines. Results : Our findings indicate that design decisions and restrictions are biased towards researchers in North American and European scholarly communities. In order to make the future open science ecosystem inclusive and operable for researchers in all world regions including Africa, Latin America, Asia and Oceania, those should be actively included in design decision processes. Conclusions : Digital open science tools carry the promise of enabling collaboration across disciplines, world regions and language groups through responsive design. We therefore encourage long term funding mechanisms and ethnically as well as culturally inclusive approaches serving local prerequisites and conditions to tool design and construction allowing a globally connected digital research infrastructure to evolve in a regionally balanced manner.},

  abstract = {Background: Grasshoppers have been used as a model system to study the neuronal basis of insect acoustic behavior. Auditory neurons have been described from intracellular recordings. The growing interest to study population activity of neurons has been satisfied so far with artificially combining data from different individuals. New method: We for the first time used multielectrode recordings from a small grasshopper brain. We used three 12. {$\mu$}m tungsten wires (combined in a multielectrode) to record from local brain neurons and from a population of auditory neurons entering the brain from the thorax. Spikes of the recorded units were separated by sorting algorithms and spike collision analysis. Results: The tungsten wires enabled stable recordings with high signal to noise ratio. Due to the tight temporal coupling of auditory activity to the stimulus spike collisions were frequent and collision analysis retrieved 10-15\% of additional spikes. Marking the electrode position was possible using a fluorescent dye or electrocoagulation with high current. Physiological identification of units described from intracellular recordings was hard to achieve. Comparison with existing methods: 12. {$\mu$}m tungsten wires gave a better signal to noise ratio than 15. {$\mu$}m copper wires previously used in recordings from bees' brains. Recording the population activity of auditory neurons in one individual prevents interindividual and trial-to-trial variability which otherwise reduce the validity of the analysis. Double intracellular recordings have quite low success rate and therefore are rarely achieved and their stability is much lower than that of multielectrode recordings which allows sampling of data for 30. min or more.},

We exposed SF to completely dark conditions and identified numerous altered traits at both the gene expression and phenotypic levels. Remarkably, most of these alterations mimicked CF phenotypes. Our results indicate that many cave-related traits can appear within a single generation by phenotypic plasticity. In the next generation, plasticity can be further refined. The initial plastic responses are random in adaptive outcome but may determine the subsequent course of evolution. Our study suggests that phenotypic plasticity contributes to the rapid evolution of cave-related traits in A. mexicanus.},

At the core of the theory-light approach is a minimal commitment about the relation between phenomenal consciousness and cognition that is compatible with many specific theories of consciousness: the hypothesis that phenomenally conscious perception of a stimulus facilitates, relative to unconscious perception, a cluster of cognitive abilities in relation to that stimulus. This ``facilitation hypothesis'' can productively guide inquiry into invertebrate consciousness. What is needed? At this stage, not more theory, and not more undirected data gathering.

Broad sense repeatability is most often inferred from the statistic R (the intraclass correlation, or narrow sense repeatability). However, R ignores change over time, despite the inherent longitudinal nature of the data (repeated measures over time). Here, we begin by showing that most studies ignore time-related change when estimating broad sense repeatability, and estimate R with low statistical power. Given this problem, we (1) outline how and why ignoring time-related change in scores (that occurs for whatever reason) can seriously affect estimates of the broad sense repeatability of behavioural or physiological traits, (2) discuss conditions in which various indices of R can or cannot provide reliable estimates of broad sense repeatability, and (3) provide suggestions for experimental designs for future studies. Finally, given that we already have abundant evidence that many labile traits are `repeatable' in that broad sense (i.e. R{$>$}0), we suggest a shift in focus towards obtaining robust estimates of the repeatability of behavioural and physiological traits. Given how labile these traits are, this will require greater experimental (and/or statistical) control and larger sample sizes in order to detect and quantify change over time (if present).},

  abstract = {Daily rhythms of physiology and behaviour are governed by an endogenous timekeeping mechanism (a circadian 'clock'). The alternation of environmental light and darkness synchronizes (entrains) these rhythms to the natural day-night cycle, and underlying mechanisms have been investigated using singly housed animals in the laboratory. But, most species ordinarily would not live out their lives in such seclusion; in their natural habitats, they interact with other individuals, and some live in colonies with highly developed social structures requiring temporal synchronization. Social cues may thus be critical to the adaptive function of the circadian system, but elucidating their role and the responsible mechanisms has proven elusive. Here, we highlight three model systems that are now being applied to understanding the biology of socially synchronized circadian oscillators: the fruitfly, with its powerful array of molecular genetic tools; the honeybee, with its complex natural society and clear division of labour; and, at a different level of biological organization, the rodent suprachiasmatic nucleus, site of the brain's circadian clock, with its network of mutually coupled single-cell oscillators. Analyses at the 'group' level of circadian organization will likely generate a more complex, but ultimately more comprehensive, view of clocks and rhythms and their contribution to fitness in nature. \textcopyright{} 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

  abstract = {Circadian rhythms are ubiquitous in many organisms. Animals that are forced to be active around the clock typically show reduced performance, health and survival. Nevertheless, we review evidence of animals showing prolonged intervals of activity with attenuated or nil overt circadian rhythms and no apparent ill effects. We show that around-the-clock and ultradian activity patterns are more common than is generally appreciated, particularly in herbivores, in animals inhabiting polar regions and habitats with constant physical environments, in animals during specific life-history stages (such as migration or reproduction), and in highly social animals. The underlying mechanisms are diverse, but studies suggest that some circadian pacemakers continue to measure time in animals active around the clock. The prevalence of around-the-clock activity in diverse animals and habitats, and an apparent diversity of underlying mechanisms, are consistent with convergent evolution. We suggest that the basic organizational principles of the circadian system and its complexity encompass the potential for chronobiological plasticity. There may be trade-offs between benefits of persistent daily rhythms versus plasticity, which for reasons still poorly understood make overt daily arrhythmicity functionally adaptive only in selected habitats and for selected lifestyles.},

Behaviors of interest are often scored manually, which is time-consuming, limited to few behaviors, and variable across researchers. We created DeepEthogram: software that uses supervised machine learning to convert raw video pixels into an ethogram, the behaviors of interest present in each video frame. DeepEthogram is designed to be general-purpose and applicable across species, behaviors, and video-recording hardware. It uses convolutional neural networks to compute motion, extract features from motion and images, and classify features into behaviors. Behaviors are classified with above 90\% accuracy on single frames in videos of mice and flies, matching expert-level human performance. DeepEthogram accurately predicts rare behaviors, requires little training data, and generalizes across subjects. A graphical interface allows beginning-to-end analysis without end-user programming. DeepEthogram's rapid, automatic, and reproducible labeling of researcher-defined behaviors of interest may accelerate and enhance supervised behavior analysis.

It is based on a small conference at the Samoset Resort in Rockport, Maine, USA, in July of 2012, organized by the Mind Science Foundation of San Antonio, Texas. Here, we summarize recent advances in our understanding of subjectivity in humans and other animals, including empirical, applied, technical, and conceptual insights. These include the evidence for the importance of fronto-parietal connectivity and of "top-down" processes, both of which enable information to travel across distant cortical areas effectively, as well as numerous dissociations between consciousness and cognitive functions, such as attention, in humans. In addition, we describe the development of mental imagery paradigms, which made it possible to identify covert awareness in non-responsive subjects. Non-human animal consciousness research has also witnessed substantial advances on the specific role of cortical areas and higher order thalamus for consciousness, thanks to important technological enhancements. In addition, much progress has been made in the understanding of non-vertebrate cognition relevant to possible conscious states. Finally, major advances have been made in theories of consciousness, and also in their comparison with the available evidence. Along with reviewing these findings, each author suggests future avenues for research in their field of investigation.},

  abstract = {Sleep was analysed in 8 young adult subjects during two baseline nights and two recovery nights following 40.5 h sleep deprivation. Sleep stages were scored from the polygraph records according to conventional criteria. In addition, the EEG records of the entire nights were subjected to spectral analysis to compute the frequency distribution of the power density in the 0.25-25 Hz range for 0.5 Hz or 1.0 Hz bins. In the first recovery night, the power density in the delta band was significantly higher than baseline for total sleep time as well as for sleep stages 2, 3 and 4, 4 and REM. These changes were not restricted to the delta band, but extended to higher frequency bands. Minor, but significant, effects of sleep deprivation were seen in the power density distribution of the second recovery night. In the baseline nights, a progressive reduction of power density in the delta/theta range was present for successive non-REM-REM sleep cycles for total sleep time and stages 2, 3 and 4, and 4. The results show that effects of sleep deprivation as well as trends within the sleep periods are readily apparent from spectral analysis, but are inadequately reflected by conventional sleep scoring. When the power density values were integrated over the entire frequency range (0.75-25 Hz) for each non-REM-REM sleep cycle, an exponential decline from cycle 1 to cycle 3 was suggested. The present findings support the hypothesis that the EEG power density in the low frequency range is an indicator of a progressively declining process during sleep whose initial value is determined by the duration of prior waking. \textcopyright{} 1981.},

  abstract = {In the last three decades the two-process model of sleep regulation has served as a major conceptual framework in sleep research. It has been applied widely in studies on fatigue and performance and to dissect individual differences in sleep regulation. The model posits that a homeostatic process (Process S) interacts with a process controlled by the circadian pacemaker (Process C), with time-courses derived from physiological and behavioural variables. The model simulates successfully the timing and intensity of sleep in diverse experimental protocols. Electrophysiological recordings from the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) suggest that S and C interact continuously. Oscillators outside the SCN that are linked to energy metabolism are evident in SCN-lesioned arrhythmic animals subjected to restricted feeding or methamphetamine administration, as well as in human subjects during internal desynchronization. In intact animals these peripheral oscillators may dissociate from the central pacemaker rhythm. A sleep/fast and wake/feed phase segregate antagonistic anabolic and catabolic metabolic processes in peripheral tissues. A deficiency of Process S was proposed to account for both depressive sleep disturbances and the antidepressant effect of sleep deprivation. The model supported the development of novel non-pharmacological treatment paradigms in psychiatry, based on manipulating circadian phase, sleep and light exposure. In conclusion, the model remains conceptually useful for promoting the integration of sleep and circadian rhythm research. Sleep appears to have not only a short-term, use-dependent function; it also serves to enforce rest and fasting, thereby supporting the optimization of metabolic processes at the appropriate phase of the 24-h cycle.},

Reflected and scattered light contributes to skyglow over cities and large industrial complexes. ALAN is one of the key drivers of insect declines in the Anthropocene era. This is the likely consequence of perturbations in circadian clocks by extension and even abolition of the dark phase of the diel cycle, which affect reproduction and foraging. Bioluminescent insects that use light as sexual signals are severely affected by ALAN and may be under sexual selection for even brighter signals. The phototactic response of insects to light is also causing mortality due to increased predation and altered activity. Mitigatory measures are urgently needed to stem insect declines and to `protect' the role of insects in community ecology. New satellite technology for ALAN measurement is urgently required. There are many research gaps, such as the effect of ALAN on diurnal insects and on interaction networks, that need to be filled.},

Here we review our current understanding of processing of optic flow as generated by an animal's self-motion. Optic flow processing is accomplished in a series of steps: First, the time-varying photoreceptor signals are fed into a two-dimensional array of Reichardt-type elementary motion detectors (EMDs). EMDs compute, in parallel, local motion vectors at each sampling point in space. Second, the output signals of many EMDs are spatially integrated on the dendrites of large-field tangential cells in the lobula plate. In the third step, tangential cells form extensive interactions with each other, giving rise to their large and complex receptive fields. Thus, tangential cells can act as matched filters tuned to optic flow during particular flight maneuvers. They finally distribute their information onto postsynaptic descending neurons, which either instruct the motor centers of the thoracic ganglion for flight and locomotion control or act themselves as motor neurons that control neck muscles for head movements.},

Twelve male long jumpers participated in this investigation and were divided into two groups based on their flight technique (hang group, n = 6; hitch kick group, n = 6). The participants performed three jumps with full run-up, the best of which was selected for analysis. A two-dimensional DLT analysis of the take-off, flight, and landing was conducted for the two groups. Three cameras (JVC GR-DVL 9800 GL, Victor Company, Japan) with a sampling frequency 50 Hz were used. Two of the cameras were placed perpendicular to the run-up, on the right and left side of the take-off board, to record the take-off and the flight of the athletes (from both sides of the movement); the third was placed perpendicular to the pit, on the right side, to record the landing. The two groups differed in their angular momentum at the instant of take-off (hang: -11.92 kg{$\cdot$}m2{$\cdot$}s-1; hitch kick: -22.69 kg{$\cdot$}m2{$\cdot$}s-1; P{$<$}0.001) in the front direction, and in linear and angular velocity, mainly of the arms, at the instant of take-off. According to the results, the 21/2 hitch kick group had greater angular and linear velocities (P{$<$}0.05). The 21/ 2 hitch kick group had better landing efficiency than the hang style group (P{$<$}0.05), as the athletes in the former group managed to land their pelvis in front of their heels during landing. On the other hand, the hang style group landed their pelvis almost 5.81 cm behind the heels during landing and shortened their final distance. It seems that the 21/ 2 hitch kick group had better landing efficiency because of their greater amount of angular momentum. The hang style group could have achieved better landing through an increase in angular momentum, which depends on an increase of the linear and angular velocities of the two arms during take-off.},

  abstract = {A major factor underlying several of scholarship's most pressing problems is its antiquated journal system with its trifecta of reproducibility, affordability and functionality crises. Any solution needs to not only solve the current problems but also be capable of preventing a takeover by corporations. Technically, there is broad agreement on the goal for a modern scholarly digital infrastructure: it needs to replace traditional journals with a decentralized, resilient, evolvable network that is interconnected by open standards under the governance of the scholarly community. It needs to replace the monopolies of current journals with a genuine, functioning and well-regulated market. In this new market, substitutable service providers compete and innovate according to the conditions of the scholarly community, avoiding further vendor lock-in. Redirection of funding from the legacy publishers to the new framework may be realized by a tried-and-tested incentive system: Funding agencies have ensured minimum standards at funded institutions by requiring specific infrastructures. These requirements, updated to include the new framework, provide exquisite incentives for institutions to redirect their infrastructure funds from antiquated journals to modern technology. At the same time and enabled by this plan, new, modern and adaptable reputation systems, long demanded by the scientific community, can finally be implemented. Ownership involves socially recognized economic rights, first and foremost the exclusive control over that property, with the self-efficacy it affords. The inability to exert such control over crucial components of their scholarly infrastructure in the face of a generally recognized need for action for over three decades now, evinces the dramatic erosion of real ownership rights for the scholarly community over said infrastructure. Thus, this proposal is motivated not only by the now very urgent need to restore such ownership to the scholarly community, but also by the understanding that through their funding bodies, scholars may have an effective and proven avenue at their disposal to identify game-changing actions and to design a financial incentive structure for recipient institutions that can help realize the restoration of ownership, with the goal to implement open digital infrastructures that are as effective and as invisible as their non-digital counterparts.},

Can the temporal structure of a stimulus interfere with, or even disrupt, the spatiotemporal structure of the neural representation? We investigated this potential confound in the locust olfactory system. When odors were presented in trains of nearly overlapping pulses, responses of first-order interneurons (projection neurons) changed reliably, and often markedly, with pulse position as responses to one pulse interfered with subsequent responses. However, using the responses of an ensemble of projection neurons, we could accurately classify the odorants as well as characterize the temporal properties of the stimulus. Further, we found that second-order follower neurons showed firing patterns consistent with the information in the projection-neuron ensemble. Thus, ensemble-based spatiotemporal coding could disambiguate complex and potentially confounding temporally structured sensory stimuli and thereby provide an invariant response to a stimulus presented in various ways. \textcopyright{} 2005 Nature Publishing Group.}

Thus, in Octopus as in vertebrates, brain areas involved in memory or 'higher' processes exhibit 'off-line' activity during rest periods. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Background Drosophila melanogaster is a leading genetic model for studying the neural regulation of sleep. Sleep is associated with changes in behavior and physiological state that are largely conserved across species. The investigation of sleep in flies has predominantly focused on behavioral readouts of sleep because physiological measurements, including changes in brain activity and metabolic rate, are less accessible. We have previously used stop-flow indirect calorimetry to measure whole body metabolic rate in single flies and have shown that in flies, like mammals, metabolic rate is reduced during sleep. New method Here, we describe a modified version of this system that allows for efficient and highly sensitive acquisition of CO2 output from single flies. Results In this modified system, we show that sleep-dependent changes in metabolic rate are diminished in aging flies, supporting the notion that sleep quality is reduced as flies age. We also describe a modification that allows for simultaneous acquisition of CO2 and O2 levels, providing a respiratory quotient that quantifies how metabolic stores are utilized. We find that the respiratory quotient identified in flies on an all-sugar diet is suggestive of lipogenesis, where the dietary sugar provided to the flies is being converted to fat. Comparison with existing methods and conclusions Taken together, the measurement of metabolic rate via indirect calorimetry not only provides a physiological readout of sleep depth, but also provides insight the metabolic regulation of nutrient utilization, with broad applications to genetic studies in flies.},

  abstract = {Summary. A common application of multilevel models is to apportion the variance in the response according to the different levels of the data. Whereas partitioning variances is straightforward in models with a continuous response variable with a normal error distribution at each level, the extension of this partitioning to models with binary responses or to proportions or counts is less obvious. We describe methodology due to Goldstein and co-workers for apportioning variance that is attributable to higher levels in multilevel binomial logistic models. This partitioning they referred to as the variance partition coefficient. We consider extending the variance partition coefficient concept to data sets when the response is a proportion and where the binomial assumption may not be appropriate owing to overdispersion in the response variable. Using the literacy data from the 1991 Indian census we estimate simple and complex variance partition coefficients at multiple levels of geography in models with significant overdispersion and thereby establish the relative importance of different geographic levels that influence educational disparities in India.},

What I somewhat polemically call the algorithms of mindfulness describes an ideal that determines algorithmic techniques of the self, geared at emotional resilience and creative cognition. A reframing of rest, exemplified in corporate mindfulness programs and the design of experimental artificial neural networks sits at the heart of this process. Mindfulness trainings provide cues as to this reframing, for they detail each in their own way how intermittent periods of rest are to be recruited to augment our cognitive capacities and combat the effects of stress and information overload. They typically rely on and co-opt neuroscience knowledge about what the brains of North Americans and Europeans do when we rest. Current designs for artificial neural networks draw on the same neuroscience research and incorporate coarse principles of cognition in brains to make machine learning systems more resilient and creative. These algorithmic techniques are primarily conceived to prevent psychopathologies where stress is considered the driving force of success. Against this backdrop, I ask how machine learning systems could be employed to unsettle the concept of pathological cognition itself.},

Here, we put forward an evolutionary hypothesis for the origin of the depolarization-contraction-secretion (DCS) coupling, the functional core of animal neuromuscular circuits. We propose that DCS coupling evolved in unicellular stem eukaryotes as part of an `emergency response' to calcium influx upon membrane rupture. We detail how this initial response was subsequently modified into an ancient mechanosensory-effector arc, present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor, which enabled contractile amoeboid movement that is widespread in extant eukaryotes. Elaborating on calciumtriggered membrane depolarization, we reason that the first action potentials evolved alongside the membrane of sensory-motile cilia, with the first voltage-sensitive sodium/calcium channels (Nav/Cav) enabling a fast and coordinated response of the entire cilium to mechanosensory stimuli. From the cilium, action potentials then spread across the entire cell, enabling global cellular responses such as concerted contraction in several independent eukaryote lineages. In animals, this process led to the invention of mechanosensory contractile cells. These gave rise to mechanosensory receptor cells, neurons and muscle cells by division of labour and can be regarded as the founder cell type of the nervous system.},

  abstract = {How to Make Decisions Recently, a number of methods to probe internal properties of nonlinear neural systems have been developed. In these methods, highly variable stimuli are used to explore the input space of the system. Neural responses are then studied using models that take advantage of the known trial-by-trial stimulus information. Brunton et al. (p. 95) adapted this combined approach to decision-making. Both in rats and humans, the diffusion constant of the drift-diffusion model of decision-making was zero, implying that the noise is all in the processing of sensory input and not in the evidence accumulator. In addition, rats gradually accumulated evidence for decision-making, with strong effects of sensory adaptation on gradual accumulation of evidence. The gradual and noisy accumulation of evidence is a fundamental component of decision-making, with noise playing a key role as the source of variability and errors. However, the origins of this noise have never been determined. We developed decision-making tasks in which sensory evidence is delivered in randomly timed pulses, and analyzed the resulting data with models that use the richly detailed information of each trial's pulse timing to distinguish between different decision-making mechanisms. This analysis allowed measurement of the magnitude of noise in the accumulator's memory, separately from noise associated with incoming sensory evidence. In our tasks, the accumulator's memory was noiseless, for both rats and humans. In contrast, the addition of new sensory evidence was the primary source of variability. We suggest our task and modeling approach as a powerful method for revealing internal properties of decision-making processes. A model of decision-making that is based on the accumulative processing of noisy information is described.

  abstract = {Free-flying honeybees exhibit remarkable cognitive capacities but the neural underpinnings of these capacities cannot be studied in flying insects. Conversely, immobilized bees are accessible to neurobiological investigation but display poor visual learning. To overcome this limitation, we aimed at establishing a controlled visual environment in which tethered bees walking on a spherical treadmill learn to discriminate visual stimuli video projected in front of them. Freely flying bees trained to walk into a miniature Y-maze displaying these stimuli in a dark environment learned the visual discrimination efficiently when one of them (CS+) was paired with sucrose and the other with quinine solution (CS-). Adapting this discrimination to the treadmill paradigm with a tethered, walking bee was successful as bees exhibited robust discrimination and preferred the CS+ to the CS- after training. As learning was better in the maze, movement freedom, active vision and behavioral context might be important for visual learning. The nature of the punishment associated with the CS- also affects learning as quinine and distilled water enhanced the proportion of learners. Thus, visual learning is amenable to a controlled environment in which tethered bees learn visual stimuli, a result that is important for future neurobiological studies in virtual reality.},

  abstract = {To study visual learning in honey bees, we developed a virtual reality (VR) system in which the movements of a tethered bee walking stationary on a spherical treadmill update the visual panorama presented in front of it (closed-loop conditions), thus creating an experience of immersion within a virtual environment. In parallel, we developed a small Y-maze with interchangeable end-boxes, which allowed replacing repeatedly a freely walking bee into the starting point of the maze for repeated decision recording. Using conditioning and transfer experiments between the VR setup and the Y-maze, we studied the extent to which movement freedom and active vision are crucial for learning a simple color discrimination. Approximately 57\% of the bees learned the visual discrimination in both conditions. Transfer from VR to the maze improved significantly the bees' performances: 75\% of bees having chosen the CS+ continued doing so and 100\% of bees having chosen the CS- reverted their choice in favor of the CS+. In contrast, no improvement was seen for these two groups of bees during the reciprocal transfer from the Y-maze to VR. In this case, bees exhibited inconsistent choices in the VR setup. The asymmetric transfer between contexts indicates that the information learned in each environment may be different despite the similar learning success. Moreover, it shows that reducing the possibility of active vision and movement freedom in the passage from the maze to the VR impairs the expression of visual learning while increasing them in the reciprocal transfer improves it. Our results underline the active nature of visual processing in bees and allow discussing the developments required for immersive VR experiences in insects.},

  abstract = {In the theoretical part of the present work the input-output relation for a multi-input system is developed into a functional power series. This is formally equivalent to a decomposition of the system into a sum of all possible combinations of 1-, 2-, 3-... input subsystems. The average response of the system to a uniformly moving pattern is known to be a Fdurler series with respect to spatial frequency. The coefficients of the series are linear combinations of the "weights" by which different subsystems contribute to the total reaction. If a system can be shown to have essential nonlinearities of no higher than second order it is possible to calculate, from a Fourier analysis of the average movement response, the "weight" by which the nonlinear interaction between any two input elements contributes to the total reaction. This interaction ,is termed "elementary movement detector". By the ana!ysis presented here the arrangement of the elementary movement detectors may be deter- mined for a two-dimensional array of input elements and the strength of their contributions to the total movement reaction may be calculated. Special ex- perimental methods have been developed which allow one to apply this analysis to the visual system of the fruitfly Drosophila. The preliminary data presented show that the direction sensitive optomotor response of Drosophila can be attributed predominantly to the contributions from two "elementary movement detec- tors" which interconnect neighbouring visual elements. The detectors are oriented in the hexagonal array of the compound eye at + 30\textasciitilde{} and at - 3 0 \textasciitilde{} with respect to the horizontal line of symmetry. A weak contribu- tion from a detector between neighbouring elements along the horizontal line of symmetry is suggested by the present data, In the course of the analysis the contrast tra'nsfer properties of the compound eye are characterized.},

We present here detailed information about the paths of Cataglyphis fortis desert ants navigating by an innate strategy, namely path integration. Firstly, we observed that the ants' walking speed decreases significantly along their homing paths, such that they slow down just before reaching the goal, and maintain a slower speed during subsequent search paths. Interestingly, this drop in walking speed is independent of absolute home-vector length and depends on the proportion of the home vector that has been completed. Secondly, we found that ants are influenced more strongly by novel or altered visual cues the further along the homing path they are. These results suggest that path integration modulates speed along the homing path in a way that might help ants search for, utilise or learn environmental information at important locations. Ants walk more slowly and sinuously when encountering novel or altered visual cues and occasionally stop and scan the world; this might indicate the re-learning of visual information.},

  abstract = {The fundamental nature of impact testing requires a cautious approach to signal processing, to minimize noise while preserving important signal information. However, few recommendations exist regarding the most suitable filter frequency cut-offs to achieve these goals. Therefore, the purpose of this investigation is twofold: to illustrate how residual analysis can be utilized to quantify optimal system-specific filter cut-off frequencies for force, moment, and acceleration data resulting from in-vitro upper extremity impacts, and to show how optimal cut-off frequencies can vary based on impact condition intensity. Eight human cadaver radii specimens were impacted with a pneumatic impact testing device at impact energies that increased from 20. J, in 10. J increments, until fracture occurred. The optimal filter cut-off frequency for pre-fracture and fracture trials was determined with a residual analysis performed on all force and acceleration waveforms. Force and acceleration data were filtered with a dual pass, 4th order Butterworth filter at each of 14 different cut-off values ranging from 60. Hz to 1500. Hz. Mean (SD) pre-fracture and fracture optimal cut-off frequencies for the force variables were 605.8 (82.7). Hz and 513.9 (79.5). Hz, respectively. Differences in the optimal cut-off frequency were also found between signals (e.g. Fx (medial-lateral), Fy (superior-inferior), Fz (anterior-posterior)) within the same test. These optimal cut-off frequencies do not universally agree with the recommendations of filtering all upper extremity impact data using a cut-off frequency of 600. Hz. This highlights the importance of quantifying the filter frequency cut-offs specific to the instrumentation and experimental set-up. Improper digital filtering may lead to erroneous results and a lack of standardized approaches makes it difficult to compare findings of in-vitro dynamic testing between laboratories. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Therefore, arguments about using AIC versus BIC for model selection cannot be from a Bayes versus frequentist perspective.

Here we used calcium imaging to assess how the Kenyon cells in the fly mushroom bodies change their activity and reactivity to stimuli during sleep, wake, and after short or long sleep deprivation. As before, sleep was defined as a period of immobility of {$>$}5 min associated with a reduced behavioral response to a stimulus. We found that calcium levels in Kenyon cells decline when flies fall asleep and increase when they wake up. Moreover, calcium transients in response to two different stimuli are larger in awake flies than in sleeping flies. The activity of Kenyon cells is also affected by sleep/wake history: in awake flies, more cells are spontaneously active and responding to stimuli if the last several hours (5-8 h) before imaging were spent awake rather than asleep. By contrast, long wake ({$\geq$}29 h) reduces both baseline and evoked neural activity and decreases the ability of neurons to respond consistently to the same repeated stimulus. The latter finding may underlie some of the negative effects of sleep deprivation on cognitive performance and is consistent with the occurrence of local sleep during wake as described in behaving rats. Thus, calcium imaging uncovers new similarities between fly and mammalian sleep: fly neurons are more active and reactive in wake than in sleep, and their activity tracks sleep/wake history.},

  abstract = {This study focuses on phylogenetic relationships in two distinct species assemblages of cave-dwelling beetles with similar disjunct distributions in the Pyrenees and Sardinia. One assemblage contains six species in the genera Ovobathysciola (four species) and Patriziella (two species) on Sardinia and one species of Anillochlamys in the Pyrenees. Species within the two Sardinian genera co-occur in the same karst area. Although, they are believed to be each others closest relative, they have very different body types (globular body with short appendages in Ovobathysciola; elongated body with long appendages in Patriziella), which are believed to reflect different degrees of adaptation to cave life. The other assemblage of Bathysciine beetles includes three species in the genus Speonomus in the Pyrenees and one on Sardinia. All the species are rare and many are endangered. One issue of particular interest was whether Ovobathysciola and Patriziella are reciprocally monophyletic or whether each of the Patriziella species evolved independently from the co-occurring Ovobathysciola species, as the similar morphology of the Patriziella species might be due to convergence rather than common descent. Based on DNA sequences of the cytochrome oxidase I (COI) region of the mtDNA, neither scenario was supported. Rather, the two Patriziella species are sister taxa embedded within the Ovobathysciola radiation. In addition, the well-dated geological history of this region allowed us to calibrate absolute rates of COI evolution, the first such estimates for any insect. Finally this study suggests that the evolutionary acquisition of typical cave adaptations (e.g., elongated body and appendages) may occur at about the same rate as loss of traits (e.g., eyes and pigmentation) associated with cave life.},

Biological self-organization amounts to the minimization of surprise over time. We posit that any self-organizing system must embody a generative model whose predictions ensure that (expected) free energy is minimized through action. Plants respond in a fast, and yet coordinated manner, to environmental contingencies. They pro-actively sample their local environment to elicit information with an adaptive value. Our main thesis is that plant behaviour takes place by way of a process (active inference) that predicts the environmental sources of sensory stimulation. This principle, we argue, endows plants with a form of perception that underwrites purposeful, anticipatory behaviour. The aim of the article is to assess the prospects of a radical predictive processing story that would follow naturally from the free-energy principle for biological systems; an approach that may ultimately bear upon our understanding of life and cognition more broadly.},

While recent evidence has demonstrated the extent to which each of these cues can be used independently, less is known about how they are integrated when simultaneously present. Many studies have shown that sensory information is integrated using a weighted linear sum, yet little is known about whether this holds true for the integration of visual and body-based cues for travelled distance perception. In this study using Virtual Reality technologies, participants first travelled a predefined distance and subsequently matched this distance by adjusting an egocentric, in-depth target. The visual stimulus consisted of a long hallway and was presented in stereo via a head-mounted display. Body-based cues were provided either by walking in a fully tracked free-walking space (Exp. 1) or by being passively moved in a wheelchair (Exp. 2). Travelled distances were provided either through optic flow alone, body-based cues alone or through both cues combined. In the combined condition, visually specified distances were either congruent (1.0\texttimes ) or incongruent (0.7\texttimes{} or 1.4\texttimes ) with distances specified by body-based cues. Responses reflect a consistent combined effect of both visual and body-based information, with an overall higher influence of body-based cues when walking and a higher influence of visual cues during passive movement. When comparing the results of Experiments 1 and 2, it is clear that both proprioceptive and vestibular cues contribute to travelled distance estimates during walking. These observed results were effectively described using a basic linear weighting model.},

In insects, only a few descending neurons have been associated with specific behaviors. To explore how descending neurons control an insect's movements, we developed a novel method to systematically assay the behavioral effects of activating individual neurons on freely behaving terrestrial D. melanogaster. We calculated a two-dimensional representation of the entire behavior space explored by these flies, and we associated descending neurons with specific behaviors by identifying regions of this space that were visited with increased frequency during optogenetic activation. Applying this approach across a large collection of descending neurons, we found that (1) activation of most of the descending neurons drove stereotyped behaviors, (2) in many cases multiple descending neurons activated similar behaviors, and (3) optogenetically activated behaviors were often dependent on the behavioral state prior to activation.},

Amphibians comprise the terrestrial vertebrates most sensitive to vibrations, and since communication is crucial to their survival and reproduction, they are a suitable model for investigating this timely subject. Playback tests were used to assess the effects of substrate vibrations produced by two sources of anthropogenic activity\textendash{} road traffic and wind turbines\textendash{} on the calling activity of a na\"ive population of terrestrial toads. In their natural habitat, a buried tactile sound transducer was used to emit simulated traffic and wind turbine vibrations, and changes in the toads' acoustic responses were analyzed by measuring parameters important for reproductive success: call rate, call duration and dominant frequency. Our results showed a significant call rate reduction by males of Alytes obstetricans in response to both seismic sources, whereas other~parameters remained stable. Since females of several species prefer males with higher call rates, our results suggest that anthropogenically derived substrate-borne vibrations could reduce individual reproductive success. Our study demonstrates a clear negative effect of anthropogenic vibrations on anuran communication, and the urgent need for further investigation in this area.},

  abstract = {Escape behaviors are, by necessity, fast and robust, making them excellent systems with which to study the neural basis of behavior. This is especially true in insects, which have comparatively tractable nervous systems and members who are amenable to manipulation with genetic tools. Recent technical developments in high-speed video reveal that, despite their short duration, insect escape behaviors are more complex than previously appreciated. For example, before initiating an escape jump, a fly performs sophisticated posture and stimulus-dependent preparatory leg movements that enable it to jump away from a looming threat. This newfound flexibility raises the question of how the nervous system generates a behavior that is both rapid and flexible. Recordings from the cricket nervous system suggest that synchrony between the activity of specific interneuron pairs may provide a rapid cue for the cricket to detect the direction of an approaching predator and thus which direction it should run. Technical advances make possible wireless recording from neurons while locusts escape from a looming threat, enabling, for the first time, a direct correlation between the activity of multiple neurons and the time-course of an insect escape behavior.},

  abstract = {Entropy is a dimensionless quantity that is used for measuring uncertainty about the state of a system but it can also imply physical qualities, where high entropy is synonymous with high disorder. Entropy is applied here in the context of states of consciousness and their associated neurodynamics, with a particular focus on the psychedelic state. The psychedelic state is considered an exemplar of a primitive or primary state of consciousness that preceded the development of modern, adult, human, normal waking consciousness. Based on neuroimaging data with psilocybin, a classic psychedelic drug, it is argued that the defining feature of "primary states" is elevated entropy in certain aspects of brain function, such as the repertoire of functional connectivity motifs that form and fragment across time. Indeed, since there is a greater repertoire of connectivity motifs in the psychedelic state than in normal waking consciousness, this implies that primary states may exhibit "criticality," i.e., the property of being poised at a "critical" point in a transition zone between order and disorder where certain phenomena such as power-law scaling appear. Moreover, if primary states are critical, then this suggests that entropy is suppressed in normal waking consciousness, meaning that the brain operates just below criticality. It is argued that this entropy suppression furnishes normal waking consciousness with a constrained quality and associated metacognitive functions, including reality-testing and self-awareness. It is also proposed that entry into primary states depends on a collapse of the normally highly organized activity within the default-mode network (DMN) and a decoupling between the DMN and the medial temporal lobes (which are normally significantly coupled). These hypotheses can be tested by examining brain activity and associated cognition in other candidate primary states such as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and early psychosis and comparing these with non-primary states such as normal waking consciousness and the anaesthetized state. \textcopyright{} 2014 Carhart-Harris, Leech, Hellyer, Shanahan, Feilding, Tagliazucchi, Chialvo and Nutt.},

Here the hypothesis is revisited four years on from its original publication. It is shown that the principle that the entropy of brain activity is elevated in the psychedelic state is increasingly well supported by separate and independent studies and analyses, and evidence for greater brain criticality under psychedelics is also highlighted. It is argued that heightened brain criticality enables the brain to be more sensitive to intrinsic and extrinsic perturbations which may translate as a heightened susceptibility to ``set'' and ``setting''. This updated version of the original entropic brain hypothesis now offers more concrete information on specific measures of brain entropy and suggests new studies to scrutinise it further, as well as examine its utility for describing and informing the treatment of psychiatric and neurological conditions such as depression and disorders of consciousness.

Interspecific comparisons have been suggested as important for understanding the evolution of animal personality; however, these are seldom accomplished due, in part, to the lack of statistical tools for quantifying differences and similarities in behaviour between groups of individuals. We used nine species of closely-related coral reef fishes to investigate the usefulness of ecological community analyses for the analysis of between-species behavioural differences and behavioural heterogeneity. We first documented behavioural carryover across species by observing the fishes' behaviour and measuring their response to a threatening stimulus to quantify boldness. Bold fish spent more time away from the reef and fed more than shy fish. We then used ecological community analysis tools (canonical variate analysis, multi-response permutation procedure, and permutational analysis of multivariate dispersion) and identified four `clusters' of behaviourally similar fishes, and found that the species differ in the behavioural variation expressed; some species are more behaviourally heterogeneous than others. We found that ecological community analysis tools are easily and fruitfully applied to comparative studies of personality and encourage their use by future studies.},

Despite recent interest in the study of animal personalities within behavioural ecology, the field is fraught with conceptual and methodological difficulties inherent in any young discipline. We review the current agreement of definitions and methods used in personality studies across taxa and systems, and find that current methods risk misclassifying traits. Fortunately, these problems have been faced before by other similar fields during their infancy, affording important opportunities to learn from past mistakes. We review the tools that were developed to overcome similar methodological problems in psychology. These tools emphasise the importance of attempting to measure animal personality traits using multiple tests and the care that needs to be taken when interpreting correlations between personality traits or their tests. Accordingly, we suggest an integrative theoretical framework that incorporates these tools to facilitate a robust and unified approach in the study of animal personality.},

This paper reports a study of light/dark periods on worker activity as well as sleep location, posture and the wake/sleep cycles of fire ant workers and queens located in an artificial nest chamber. Workers slept in one of three locations: on the ceiling, against the chamber wall or in the center of the chamber floor. Workers on the ceiling or against the chamber wall slept for longer periods than those at the center of the chamber floor where most grooming and feeding activity occurred. When sleeping, queens huddled together. Their close contact generated synchronized wake/sleep cycles with each other. Sleep posture was distinctly different than wake posture. During deep sleep, queens and workers folded their antennae and were non-responsive to contact by other ants. Another indicator of deep sleep was rapid antennal movement (RAM sleep). Sleep episodes were polyphasic. Queens averaged \textasciitilde 92 sleep episodes per day, each episode lasting \textasciitilde 6 min, for a total of \textasciitilde 9.4 h of sleep per day. Workers averaged \textasciitilde 253 sleep episodes lasting 1.1 min each for a total of \textasciitilde 4.8 h of sleep per day. Activity episodes were unaffected by light/dark periods. Workers were hypervigilant with an average of 80\% of the labor force completing grooming, feeding or excavation tasks at any given time. These findings reinforce the parental exploitation hypothesis-sterile workers are a caste of disposable, short-lived helpers whose vigilance and hyperactivty increases the queen's fitness by buffering her and her fertile offspring from environmental stresses. \textcopyright{} 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

  abstract = {Social vertebrates have a rich repertoire of communication signals and modalities. Recent work on the social insects has uncovered a diverse set of communication modalities including chemical, tactile, visual, and auditory signals to communicate a wide variety of information on the location of distant food sites, distress, and aggression. Here, we investigated abdominal wagging in the fire ant, Solenopsis invicta. We found that the abdominal ``wagging'' that occurred inside the fire ant nests differed significantly from the abdominal ``flagging'' that is known to occur outside the fire ant nests. Neither sounds nor venom was emitted during abdominal wagging inside the fire ant nests. Moreover, the incidence and duration of abdominal wagging was greater when workers were tending brood or ingesting food than when engaged in non-brood related tasks or in donating food. Lastly, inside the nests, abdominal wagging neither attracted nor repelled nearby workers. Thus, we speculate that wagging is an expression of pleasure while tending brood or ingesting food that falls along the continuum between the aggressive nature of abdominal flagging and the distress call of abdominal stridulation.},

In addition to their low maintenance costs and easy sharing of strains across labs, one key appeal is the possibility to monitor single or groups of animals in a behavioural arena while controlling the activity of select neurons using optogenetic or thermogenetic tools. However, the purchase of a com- mercial solution for these types of experiments, including an appropriate camera system as well as a controlled behavioural arena, can be costly. Here, we present a low-cost and mod- ular open-source alternative called `FlyPi'. Our design is based on a 3D-printed mainframe, a Raspberry Pi computer, and high-definition camera system as well as Arduino-based opti- cal and thermal control circuits. Depending on the configuration, FlyPi can be assembled for well under \texteuro 100 and features optional modules for light-emitting diode (LED)-based fluores- cence microscopy and optogenetic stimulation as well as a Peltier-based temperature stim- ulator for thermogenetics. The complete version with all modules costs approximately \texteuro 200 or substantially less if the user is prepared to `shop around'. All functions of FlyPi can be con- trolled through a custom-written graphical user interface. To demonstrate FlyPi's capabili- ties, we present its use in a series of state-of-the-art neurogenetics experiments. In addition, we demonstrate FlyPi's utility as a medical diagnostic tool as well as a teaching aid at Neuro- genetics courses held at several African universities. Taken together, the low cost and mod- ular nature as well as fully open design of FlyPi make it a highly versatile tool in a range of applications, including the classroom, diagnostic centres, and research labs.}

Finally, we develop a genetic reagent to destroy the indirect flight muscles and to facilitate experimental access to the VNC.

Given that these variables undergo constant fluctuations over varying time scales, how do biological control systems maintain control over these values? We explored this question in the context of phototactic behavior in larval zebrafish. We demonstrate that larval zebrafish use phototaxis to maintain environmental luminance at a set point, that the value of this set point fluctuates on a time scale of seconds when environmental luminance changes, and that it is determined by calculating the mean input across both sides of the visual field. These results expand on previous studies of flexible phototaxis in larval zebrafish; they suggest that larval zebrafish exert homeostatic control over the luminance of their surroundings, and that feedback from the surroundings drives allostatic changes to the luminance set point. As such, we describe a novel behavioral algorithm with which larval zebrafish exert control over a sensory variable.},

  abstract = {Cheeseman et al. (1) claim that an ability of honey bees to travel home through a land-scape with conflicting information from a celestial compass proves the bees' use of a cognitive map. Their claim involves a cu-rious assumption about the visual informa-tion that can be extracted from the terrain: that there is sufficient information for a bee to identify where it is, but insufficient to guide its path without resorting to a cogni-tive map. We contend that the authors' claims are unfounded. Proof that an animal uses a cognitive map requires, at the very least, results that cannot be explained by other known mechanisms. Cheeseman et al. consider only one alterna-tive mechanism to the use of a cognitive map: the association of compass directions with visual scenes (as detailed in ref. 2). They thus neglect the extensive experimental and the-oretical evidence that insects can also be guided purely by disparities between their memories of visual scenes and their cur-rent view of the world (3). It has long been known that this visual guidance in insects can operate independently of information from path integration and more generally with no celestial compass or with a conflict-ing celestial compass (4). Image analysis and modeling show that the information contained in panoramic views of natural scenes can provide guid-ance across large areas, without the need of celestial compass information or a map-like representation (4, 5). For a flying bee, such a view would include both the skyline and the ground below. The authors have failed to do any image analysis of the visual in-formation available to bees at their study site. However, based on what they supply, there is reason to expect that view-based guidance can also account for the bees' be-havior at this site (Fig. 1). With an understanding of how insects can use view-based guidance, we can go further and suggest an alternative explanation for the effect of anesthesia. Rather than acting to clock-shift the celestial compass, anesthesia may well have simply knocked out the path integration home vector. The authors claim that in one of the two conditions, the anesthetized bees follow a clock-shifted path integration home vector. This pre-dicted direction, however, coincides with the direction of the trained feeder to which at least 8 of 24 bees in experiment 1 and 7 of 12 bees in experiment 2 indeed first fly. The initial flight directions of all of the anesthetized bees can thus be explained in terms of view-based guidance toward the trained feeders, toward the trained feeder nest routes, or toward dominant landscape features. Consequently, the authors' dismissal of a proposed association of compass direc-tions with visual scenes (2) is also questionable. Taking all these points, we believe that Cheeseman et al.'s claims are not substanti-ated and that their results do not add any-thing new to the debate surrounding cognitive maps in insects.},

In some vertebrates such modulation has been observed and interpreted in the context of attention [2] and sensorimotor coordinate transformations [3].

We used two-photon imaging to monitor intracellular calcium activity in motion-sensitive lobula plate tangential cells (LPTCs) in head-fixed Drosophila walking on an air-supported ball. Cells of the horizontal system (HS) - a subgroup of LPTCs - showed stronger calcium transients in response to visual motion when flies were walking rather than resting. The amplified responses were also correlated with walking speed. Moreover, HS neurons showed a relatively higher gain in response strength at higher temporal frequencies, and their optimum temporal frequency was shifted toward higher motion speeds. Walking-dependent modulation of HS neurons in the Drosophila visual system may constitute a mechanism to facilitate processing of higher image speeds in behavioral contexts where these speeds of visual motion are relevant for course stabilization. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.}

We examined the duration, frequency and time course of various behaviors (i.e. exploration, walk, rear, stretch attend, return, groom, sit, spin turn, jump and sleep) exhibited by male mice in different regions of a novel open field. Both DZ and CDP consistently reduced the typical anxiety-like behaviors of stretch attend and wall-following (thigmotaxis), along with that of an additional new measure: 'returns', without producing any overall effects on total locomotion. The drugs also differed in their effects. CDP elicited a shift in the locomotor pattern from a 'high explore' to a 'high walk', while DZ mainly elicited alterations in sit and groom. The MAG treatment was repeated twice with both exposures reducing horizontal and vertical (rearing) activity and increasing grooming and spin turns. However, the anxiety-like behaviors of stretch attend and return were marginally reduced by only the first exposure. We conclude that a detailed ethological analysis of the OFT allows not only the detection of specific effects of drugs and non-pharmacological agents (i.e. pulsed magnetic field) on anxiety-like behaviors, but also permits the examination of non-specific effects, in particular those on general activity.},

One of the most commonly proposed functions of sleep is the consolidation of memory1\textendash 3. However, as conditions such as starvation require the organism to be awake and active4, the ability to switch to a memory consolidation mechanism that is not contingent on sleep may confer an evolutionary advantage. Here we identify an adaptive circuit-based mechanism that enables Drosophila to form sleep-dependent and sleep-independent memory. Flies fed after appetitive conditioning needed increased sleep for memory consolidation, but flies starved after training did not require sleep to form memories. Memory in fed flies is mediated by the anterior\textendash posterior {$\alpha{'}$}/{$\beta{'}$} neurons of the mushroom body, while memory under starvation is mediated by medial {$\alpha{'}$}/{$\beta{'}$} neurons. Sleep-dependent and sleep-independent memory rely on distinct dopaminergic neurons and corresponding mushroom body output neurons. However, sleep and memory are coupled such that mushroom body neurons required for sleep-dependent memory also promote sleep. Flies lacking Neuropeptide F display sleep-dependent memory even when starved, suggesting that circuit selection is determined by hunger. This plasticity in memory circuits enables flies to retain essential information in changing environments.}

Our present understanding of motor control has grown rapidly thanks to new methods for recording and analyzing populations of many individual neurons over time. In contrast, current methods for recording the nervous system`s actual motor output - the activation of muscle fibers by motor neurons - typically cannot detect the individual electrical events produced by muscle fibers during natural behaviors and scale poorly across species and muscle groups. Here we present a novel class of electrode devices (''Myomatrix arrays'') that record muscle activity at cellular resolution across muscles and behaviors. High-density, flexible electrode arrays allow for stable recordings from the muscle fibers activated by a single motor neuron, called a ''motor unit'', during natural behaviors in many species, including mice, rats, primates, songbirds, frogs, and insects. This technology therefore allows the nervous system's motor output to be monitored in unprecedented detail during complex behaviors across species and muscle morphologies. We anticipate that this technology will allow rapid advances in understanding the neural control of behavior and in identifying pathologies of the motor system.},

This view derives from what is known about primary visual cortex, where neural activity represents patterns of light. Yet it is unclear how well the analogy between motor and visual cortex holds. Single-neuron responses in motor cortex are complex, and there is marked disagreement regarding which movement parameters are represented. A better analogy might be with other motor systems, where a common principle is rhythmic neural activity. Here we find that motor cortex responses during reaching contain a brief but strong oscillatory component, something quite unexpected for a non-periodic behaviour. Oscillation amplitude and phase followed naturally from the preparatory state, suggesting a mechanistic role for preparatory neural activity. These results demonstrate an unexpected yet surprisingly simple structure in the population response. This underlying structure explains many of the confusing features of individual neural responses.},

Although insects have an extraordinary diversity of anti-predator behavioral and physiological responses, predator-induced stress has not been studied extensively in insects, especially at the molecular level. Here, we review the existing literature on physiological predator-induced stress responses in insects and compare what is known about insect stress to vertebrate stress systems. We conclude that many unrelated insects share a baseline pathway of predator-induced stress responses that we refer to as the octopamine-adipokinetic hormone (OAH) axis. We also present best practices for studying predator-induced stress responses in prey insects. We encourage investigators to compare neurophysiological responses to predator-related stress at the organismal, neurohormonal, tissue, and cellular levels within and across taxonomic groups.

Here, we review a growing body of neurophysiological data that is difficult to reconcile with this influential theoretical perspective. As an alternative foundation for interpreting neural data, we consider frameworks borrowed from ethology, which emphasize the kinds of real-time interactive behaviors that animals have engaged in for millions of years. In particular, we discuss an ethologically-inspired view of interactive behavior as simultaneous processes that specify potential motor actions and select between them. We review how recent neurophysiological data from diverse cortical and subcortical regions appear more compatible with this parallel view than with the classical view of serial information processing stages.},

  abstract = {Are the fastest running speeds achieved using the simple-spring stance mechanics predicted by the classic spring-mass model? We hypothesized that a passive, linear-spring model would not account for the running mechanics that maximize ground force application and speed. We tested this hypothesis by comparing patterns of ground force application across athletic specialization (competitive sprinters vs. athlete nonsprinters, n = 7 each) and running speed (top speeds vs. slower ones). Vertical ground reaction forces at 5.0 and 7.0 m/s, and individual top speeds (n = 797 total footfalls) were acquired while subjects ran on a custom, high-speed force treadmill. The goodness of fit between measured vertical force vs. time waveform patterns and the patterns predicted by the spring-mass model were assessed using the 2 statistic (where an 2 of 1.00 = perfect fit). As hypothesized, the force application patterns of the competitive sprinters deviated significantly more from the simple-spring pattern than those of the athlete, nonsprinters across the three test speeds (R2 {$<$}0.85 vs. 2 {$\geq$} 0.91, respectively), and deviated most at top speed (R2 = 0.78 {$\pm$} 0.02). Sprinters attained faster top speeds than nonsprinters (10.4 {$\pm$} 0.3 vs. 8.7 {$\pm$} 0.3 m/s) by applying greater vertical forces during the first half (2.65 {$\pm$} 0.05 vs. 2.21 {$\pm$} 0.05 body wt), but not the second half (1.71 {$\pm$} 0.04 vs. 1.73 {$\pm$} 0.04 body wt) of the stance phase. We conclude that a passive, simple-spring model has limited application to sprint running performance because the swiftest runners use an asymmetrical pattern of force application to maximize ground reaction forces and attain faster speeds.},

Comparing these operations across taxa reveals how different neural circuits have evolved to solve the same problem, even when using different mechanisms to implement the underlying math. In this review, we compare how insect and mammalian neural circuits have solved the problem of motion estimation, focusing on the fruit fly Drosophila and the mouse retina. Although the two systems implement computations with grossly different anatomy and molecular mechanisms, the underlying circuits transform light into motion signals with strikingly similar processing steps. These similarities run from photoreceptor gain control and spatiotemporal tuning to ON and OFF pathway structures, motion detection, and computed motion signals. The parallels between the two systems suggest that a limited set of algorithms for estimating motion satisfies both the needs of sighted creatures and the constraints imposed on them by metabolism, anatomy, and the structure and regularities of the visual world.},

  abstract = {Generalised additive models (GAMs) are increasingly popular tools for estimating smooth nonlinear relationships between predictors and response variables. GAMs are particularly relevant in ecology for representing hierarchical functions for discrete responses that encompass complex features including zero inflation, truncation and uneven sampling. However, GAMs are less useful for producing forecasts as their smooth functions provide unstable predictions outside the range of training data. We introduce dynamic generalised additive models (DGAMs), where the GAM linear predictor is jointly estimated with unobserved dynamic components to model time series that evolve as a function of nonlinear predictor associations and latent temporal processes. These models are especially useful for analysing multiple series, as they can estimate hierarchical smooth functions while learning complex temporal associations via dimension-reduced latent factor processes. We implement our models in the mvgam R package, which estimates unobserved parameters for smoothing splines and latent temporal processes in a probabilistic framework. Using simulations, we illustrate how our models outperform competing formulations in realistic ecological forecasting tasks while identifying important smooth predictor functions. We use a real-world case study to highlight some of mvgam's key features, which include functions for calculating correlations among series' latent trends, performing model selection using rolling window forecasts and posterior predictive checks, online data augmentation via a recursive particle filter and visualising probabilistic uncertainties for smooth functions and predictions. Dynamic GAMs (DGAMs) offer a solution to the challenge of forecasting discrete time series while estimating ecologically relevant nonlinear predictor associations. Our Bayesian latent factor approach will be particularly useful for exploring competing dynamic ecological models that encompass hierarchical smoothing structures while providing forecasts with robust uncertainties, tasks that are becoming increasingly important in applied ecology.},

Despite a relatively slow reaction time (194 ms), Bolt won in 9.85 s (mean velocity: 10.15 m/s). His fastest 20-m section velocity was 12.14 m/s, reached between 70-and 90-m marks, by 2.70 m long strides and 4.36 strides/s frequency. At the maximal velocity, his contact and flight times were 86 and 145 ms, respectively, and vertical ground reaction force generated equalled 4.2 times his body weight (3932 N). The braking and propulsion phase represented 37\% and 63\% of ground contact, respectively, with his centre of mass (CoM) exhibiting minor reductions in horizontal velocity (2.7\%) and minimal vertical displacement (4.9 cm) emerged Bolt's maximal sprint velocity and international predominance from his coordinated motor abilities, power generation capacities, and effective technique. This study confirms that his maximal velocity was achieved by means of relatively long strides, minimal braking phase, high vertical ground reaction force, and minimal vertical displacement of CoM.

Inputs driving place field spiking increased in amplitude \textendash{} often suddenly \textendash{} during novel environment exploration. However, these increases were not sustained in familiar environments. Rather, the spatial tuning of inputs became increasingly similar across repeated traversals of the environment with experience \textendash{} both within fields and throughout the whole environment. In novel environments, CSs were not necessary for place field formation. Our findings support a model in which initial inhomogeneities in inputs are amplified to produce robust place field activity, then plasticity refines this representation into one with less strongly modulated, but more stable, inputs for long-term storage.},

In path integration, ants compute their net distance and direction from the nest throughout their outward1 and return4 journeys, and so can always return directly home from their current location1. As the path-integration vector is updated over the entire journey, we call it a global vector. On a familiar route, when ants can steer by visual landmarks, they adopt a fixed and often circuitous path consisting of several separate segments that point in different directions2,3,5. Here we show that, as in honeybees6,7,8, such multisegment journeys are composed partly of stored local movement vectors, which are associated with landmarks and are recalled at the appropriate place. We also show that a local vector learnt at one value of the global vector can be recalled at many values, and that expression of the global vector is temporarily inhibited while the local vector is used. These results indicate that the global vector is ignored during navigation through familiar, cluttered territory, but that it re-emerges to take the ant home once the insect leaves the clutter and other guidance strategies cease to operate.},

  abstract = {Foraging animals may benefit from remembering the location of a newly discovered food patch while continuing to explore nearby [1, 2]. For example, after encountering a drop of yeast or sugar, hungry flies often perform a local search [3, 4]. That is, rather than remaining on the food or simply walking away, flies execute a series of exploratory excursions during which they repeatedly depart and return to the resource. Fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, can perform this food-centered search behavior in the absence of external landmarks, instead relying on internal (idiothetic) cues [5]. This path-integration behavior may represent a deeply conserved navigational capacity in insects [6, 7], but its underlying neural basis remains unknown. Here, we used optogenetic activation to screen candidate cell classes and found that local searches can be initiated by diverse sensory neurons. Optogenetically induced searches resemble those triggered by actual food, are modulated by starvation state, and exhibit key features of path integration. Flies perform tightly centered searches around the fictive food site, even within a constrained maze, and they can return to the fictive food site after long excursions. Together, these results suggest that flies enact local searches in response to a wide variety of food-associated cues and that these sensory pathways may converge upon a common neural system for navigation. Using a virtual reality system, we demonstrate that local searches can be optogenetically induced in tethered flies walking on a spherical treadmill, laying the groundwork for future studies to image the brain during path integration. Video Abstract: After finding a patch of food, flies use path integration to execute a local search. Using optogenetic activation, Corfas et al. show that a variety of food-associated neurons trigger this behavior and that flies can perform searches within a maze or a virtual environment. The results pave the way for studying the neural basis of path integration.},

We discovered that, unprompted by task conditions, animals slowly shifted their likelihood of detecting stimulus changes over the timescale of tens of minutes. Neural population activity from visual area V4, as well as from prefrontal cortex, slowly drifted together with these behavioral fluctuations. We found that this slow drift, rather than altering the encoding of the sensory stimulus, acted as an impulsivity signal, overriding sensory evidence to dictate the final decision.

  abstract = {An animal's self-motion generates optic flow across its retina, and it can use this visual signal to regulate its orientation and speed through the world. While orientation control has been studied extensively in Drosophila and other insects, much less is known about the visual cues and circuits that regulate translational speed. Here, we show that flies regulate walking speed with an algorithm that is tuned to the speed of visual motion, causing them to slow when visual objects are nearby. This regulation does not depend strongly on the spatial structure or the direction of visual stimuli, making it algorithmically distinct from the classic computation that controls orientation. Despite the different algorithms, the visual circuits that regulate walking speed overlap with those that regulate orientation. Taken together, our findings suggest that walking speed is controlled by a hierarchical computation that combines multiple motion detectors with distinct tunings. Video Abstract:},

  abstract = {Circular data is data that is measured on a circle in degrees or radians. It is fundamentally different from linear data due to its periodic nature (0\textdegree{} = 360\textdegree ). Circular data arises in a large variety of research fields. Among others in ecology, the medical sciences, personality measurement, educational science, sociology, and political science circular data is collected. The most direct examples of circular data within the social sciences arise in cognitive and experimental psychology. However, despite numerous examples of circular data being collected in different areas of cognitive and experimental psychology, the knowledge of this type of data is not well-spread and literature in which these types of data are analyzed using methods for circular data is relatively scarce. This paper therefore aims to give a tutorial in working with and analyzing circular data to researchers in cognitive psychology and the social sciences in general. It will do so by focusing on data inspection, model fit, estimation and hypothesis testing for two specific models for circular data using packages from the statistical programming language R.},

Indeed, variation in clock genes has been implicated in an array of plant environmental adaptations, including growth regulation, photoperiodic control of flowering, and responses to abiotic and biotic stress. Although the clock is buffered against the environment, maintaining roughly 24-h rhythms across a wide range of conditions, it can also be reset by environmental cues such as acute changes in light or temperature. These competing demands may help explain the complexity of the links between the circadian clock network and environmental response pathways. Here, we discuss our current understanding of the clock and its interactions with light and temperature-signaling pathways. We also describe different clock gene alleles that have been implicated in the domestication of important staple crops.},

These results are consistent with the novel hypothesis that the need for sleep slowly accumulates during torpor, and that returning to euthermy is periodically required to allow sleep. Sleep thus seems to be energetically expensive for a hibernating mammal, and cannot be considered solely a strategy for saving energy.},

We describe an improved spherical treadmill design that reliably registers the path and walking behaviour of an animal walking on top of the sphere. The simple and robust set-up consists of a very light hollowed styrofoam ball supported by an air stream in a hollow half sphere and can be used indoors and outdoors. Two optical mouse sensors provided with lenses of 4.6\hspace{0.25em}mm focal length detect the motion of the sphere with a temporal resolution of more than 200 frames s-1 and a spatial resolution of less than 0.2\hspace{0.25em}mm. The treadmill can be used in an open- or closed-loop configuration with respect to yaw of the animal. The tethering allows animals to freely adjust their body posture and in the closed-loop configuration to quickly rotate around their yaw axis with their own moment of inertia. In this account, we present the first evidence of naturalistic homing navigation on a spherical treadmill for two species of Cataglyphis desert ants. We were able to evaluate with good precision the walking speed and angular orientation at any time. During homing the ants showed a significant difference in walking speed between the approach and search phases; moreover, they slowed down significantly as soon as they reached zero vector state, the fictive nest position.},

The flies were flown upwind along a narrow plume of attractant odour in the mid-line of the tunnel so their visual input was specified.2.When the pattern was at a constant distance from the flies they controlled their groundspeed by flying at an airspeed such that there was a constant angular velocity of image movement rather than a constant frequency of stripe alternation over their eyes. They thus flew at the same groundspeed regardless of wind speed.3.When the distance of the pattern from the flies changed in a step, the flies adjusted their airspeed at the change so as to keep a relatively constant groundspeed. They did this by changing the angular velocity of image movement that they held constant.4.When the distance of the pattern from the flies changed gradually, on a cone rather than in a step, the flies did not adjust the angular velocity of image movement that they held constant. Their groundspeed thus did not remain constant.5.It is suggested that the flies used parallax cues, from the different apparent angular velocities visible juxtaposed on either side of a step in pattern distance, to adjust the angular velocity of image movement that they held constant.}

However, in invertebrates evidence for lateralization is restricted to olfactory memories, primarily from social bees. Here, we use a classical conditioning paradigm with a visual conditioned stimulus to show that visual memories are lateralized in the wood ant, Formica rufa. We show that a brief contact between a sugar reward and either the right or left antenna (reinforcement) is sufficient to produce a lateralized memory, even though the visual cue is visible to both eyes throughout training and testing. Reinforcement given to the right antenna induced short-term memories, whereas reinforcement given to the left antenna induced long-term memories. Thus, short- and long-term visual memories are lateralized in wood ants. This extends the modalities across which memories are lateralized in insects and suggests that such memory lateralization may have evolved multiple times, possibly linked to the evolution of eusociality in the Hymenoptera.},

  abstract = {The relationship between standing and steady walking was investigated for stick insects walking on a wheel. Normal hexapod coordination patterns ensure that each point in the gait cycle has static stability. Nevertheless, stick insects show preferred stopping sequences: the final protraction in ipsilateral metachronal sequences is most often by a front leg and least often by a rear leg (Fig. 1, Table 1). The associated preferred stance is one in which front, middle, and rear legs are spread apart (Fig. 2). This preferred stance does not conform precisely to those of steady walking, necessitating small adjustments to the walk in the final steps. First, the final leg protraction often occurs in the absence of strong retraction by the supporting legs. Second, the insect often takes advantage of the left/right asymmetry, letting rear and middle legs on the leading side retract beyond their normal endpoints while completing the metachronal sequence on the trailing side. Walking typically resumes with an initial retraction by all legs. Stances are close enough to leg configurations of steady walking that metachronal rhythms are often continuous across pauses, a feature which suggests that leg coordination is affected by peripheral parameters, such as leg position.},

Surprisingly, there is no evidence that vision can guide the selection of escape strategies. Fleeing behavior can be readily triggered by a rapidly looming overhead stimulus [4]. Freezing behavior, however, has previously been induced by real predators or their odors [5]. Here, we discover that a small moving disk, simulating the sweep of a predator cruising overhead, is sufficient to induce freezing response in mice. Looming and sweeping therefore provide visual triggers for opposing flight and freeze behaviors and provide evidence that mice innately make behavioral choices based on vision alone. Video Abstract},

A comparison of these data with major theoretical proposals suggests that firstly, conscious access must be carefully distinguished from selective attention; secondly, conscious perception may be likened to a non-linear decision that 'ignites' a network of distributed areas; thirdly, information which is selected for conscious perception gains access to additional computations, including temporary maintenance, global sharing, and flexible routing; and finally, measures of the complexity, long-distance correlation and integration of brain signals provide reliable indices of conscious processing, clinically relevant to patients recovering from coma. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Beetles present an interesting insect group to study in this respect, due to their diverse taxonomy and biology, and prevalence as agricultural pests. In this article, I review research on beetle spatial orientation. Then, I use this synthesis to discuss mechanisms beetles employ in the context of different behaviours that require orientation or navigation. I conclude by discussing two future avenues for behavioural research on this topic, which could lead to more robust conclusions on how species in this diverse order are able to traverse through a wide variety of environments.},

The horizontal elutriator was designed to simulate the particulate deposition characteristics of the human respiratory tract. Samples were collected during the period June 1964 to February 1965. Respirable and non-respirable particulate samples were analyzed for polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon content by a new technique which utilized dual column, flame ionization gas chromatography. It was possible to quantitatively analyze a concentrated benzene extract of the particulate sample for the following individual components: 1, 2 benzanthracene; chrysene; pyrene; 3,4 benzofloranthene; 1, 12 benzoperylene. It was not possible to distinguish between 3,4 benzopyrene, 1,2 benzopyrene and perylene; only the total quantity of these compounds present was detected. This analytical technique is comparable in sensitivity to formerly reported, more time-consuming methods and is very rapid, requiring less than one hour to perform after benzene extraction. Amounts of the above compounds associated with the two particulate fractions collected are reported and discussed. \textcopyright{} 1966 Air \& Waste Management Association.},

  abstract = {Background and objectives In standard practice, sleep is classified into distinct stages by human observers according to specific rules as for instance specified in the AASM manual. We here show proof of principle for a conceptualization of sleep stages as attractor states in a nonlinear dynamical system in order to develop new empirical criteria for sleep stages. Methods EEG (single channel) of two healthy sleeping participants was used to demonstrate this conceptualization. Firstly, distinct EEG epochs were selected, both detected by a MLR classifier and through manual scoring. Secondly, change point analysis was used to identify abrupt changes in the EEG signal. Thirdly, these detected change points were evaluated on whether they were preceded by early warning signals. Results Multiple change points were identified in the EEG signal, mostly in interplay with N2. The dynamics before these changes revealed, for a part of the change points, indicators of generic early warning signals, characteristic of complex systems (e.g., ecosystems, climate, epileptic seizures, global finance systems). Conclusions The sketched new framework for studying critical transitions in sleep EEG might benefit the understanding of individual and pathological differences in the dynamics of sleep stage transitions. Formalising sleep as a nonlinear dynamical system can be useful for definitions of sleep quality, i.e. stability and accessibility of an equilibrium state, and disrupted sleep, i.e. constant shifting between instable sleep states.},

  abstract = {Extracellular spiking activity and local field potentials (LFP) were recorded via tetrodes at the output of the antennal lobe (AL) in the honeybee brain during olfactory conditioning. Odors induce reliable rate responses that consist of either phasic-tonic responses, or complex responses with odor-specific profiles. In addition, odors evoke consistent responses of LFP oscillations in the 50-Hz band during the phasic ON-response to odor stimulation, and variable LFP responses at other frequency bands during the sustained response. A principal component analysis of the ensemble activity during differential conditioning consistently indicates the largest changes in response to the learned odor (conditioned stimulus; CS+). Relative LFP power increases for CS+ in the 15-40-Hz frequency band during the sustained response, and decreases for frequencies above 45 Hz. To quantify the relationship between these population responses given by the ensemble spiking activity and LFP, we show that for CS+ the learning-related changes in the degree of the phase-locked spiking activity correlate with the power changes in the corresponding frequency bands. Our results indicate associative plasticity in the AL of the bee leading to both enhancement and decrease of neuronal response rates. LFP power changes and the correlated changes in the locking between spikes and LFP at different frequencies observed for the learned odor serve as further evidence for a learning-induced restructuring of temporal ensemble representations. \textcopyright{} Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Short trails reduce both the time and energy costs of delivering food back to the nest, but which is most important? To examine trail route choice in the wood ant Formica rufa, we used a series of bridges, each with two alternative routes allowing the comparison of combinations of horizontal, vertical or time-expensive detours of differing lengths or delays. The ants preferred the shortest, quickest routes in all cases, although when vertical and horizontal deviations were equal in length they preferred the former, probably because this represents a reduced risk in terms of navigation errors. When comparing a range of bridge combinations, we were able to separate the relative differences in time versus energy saving represented within a series of successive choices. Contrary to earlier evidence, savings in energy explained significantly more of the variation in ant trail preferences than savings in time. We suggest that our results can be explained by wood ants adaptively adjusting their speed when walking in the vertical plane in response to the additional potential energy costs encountered. \textcopyright{} 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.}

First, a laboratory sample rotator is designed and demonstrated that can be used for tumbling as well as gentle mixing of samples in a variety of tube sizes by mixing them horizontally, vertically, or any position in between. Changing the mixing angle is fast and convenient and requires no tools. This device is battery powered and can be easily transported to operate in various locations in a lab including desktops, benches, clean hoods, chemical hoods, cold rooms, glove boxes, incubators or biological hoods. Second, an on-board Arduino-based microcontroller is incorporated that adds the functionality of a laboratory sample shaker. These devices can be customized both mechanically and functionally as the user can simply select the operation mode on the switch or alter the code to perform custom experiments. The open source laboratory sample rotator mixer can be built by non-specialists for under US\$30 and adding shaking functionality can be done for under \$20 more. Thus, these open source devices are technically superior to the proprietary commercial equipment available on the market while saving over 90\% of the costs.},

The effects of acute sleep deprivation on sleep duration and EEG activity in male and female rodents will also be covered, in addition to sex differences in specific circadian phenotypes. When possible, the contribution of the female estrous cycle to the observed differences between males and females will be described. In general, male rodents spend more time in non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) in comparison to females, while other differences between sexes in sleep phenotypes are species- and estrous cycle phase-dependent.

Consolidation during sleep promotes both quantitative and qualitative changes of memory representations. Through specific patterns of neuromodulatory activity and electric field potential oscillations, slow-wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep support system consolidation and synaptic consolidation, respectively. During SWS, slow oscillations, spindles and ripples at minimum cholinergic activity coordinate the re-activation and redistribution of hippocampus-dependent memories to neocortical sites, whereas during REM sleep, local increases in plasticity-related immediate-early gene activity at high cholinergic and theta activity might favour the subsequent synaptic consolidation of memories in the cortex. \textcopyright{} 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

  abstract = {Sexual displays can be energetically taxing, power-limited tests of endurance that favour the vigorous. Therefore, these displays may reliably indicate the ability to pay the energetic costs of sustained motor performance. Field cricket calling song involves the repeated mechanical movement of wings to produce pulses of sound grouped into species-specific chirp patterns, often sustained for long periods across nights. We quantified variation and repeatability of cricket calling song phenotypes and determined how age and body size impacted this variation. All our experiments involved tightly controlled signalling environments, but there was a great deal of interindividual variation in behaviour. Although there were species differences, most traits associated with signalling vigour exhibited mean level declines with age and conditional repeatability (individual{${_\ast}$}age interactions). These results suggest that males differing in quality may differ in their ability to buffer themselves against age-related changes in signalling vigour. Furthermore, the repeatability of calling traits itself changed with age, declining slightly in some species but increasing in others. We also challenged motor performance by altering dietary carbohydrate and protein; we predicted that increased carbohydrate would enhance signalling vigour and increased protein would decrease it. Although diet influenced the probability of calling and time spent calling in a predictable manner, these effects were not profound. Our findings confirm the scope for sexual selection to act on motor performance and point to ways in which constraints and trade-offs may yield variation within and among species in how vigour is signalled. In animals, behavioural personality traits have been well-documented in a wide array of species. However, these traits, different between individuals, are not completely stable in individuals. They show behavioural plasticity like many other phenotypic traits. This plasticity is able to overcome some weak aspects of personality trait behavioural strategy. In the present study, we examined the relationship between motor personality traits and behavioural plasticity in the common vole (Microtus arvalis) using a PhenoTyper (PT) box (Noldus). During a three-day test, four behavioural motor activity parameters were monitored in 47 voles: distance moved, (loco)motion duration, motion change frequency, sprint duration. Consistency repeatability (RC) of the parameters from the PT test was very high, with all values {$\geq$} 0.91. To select the best linear mixed-effect models (LMMs), several predictors (test day, sex, body weight) were tested. Only test day had a significant effect on the dependent variables and other predictors did not improve the LMMs. Further, we found significant effects of random intercepts (motor personality traits) and slopes (behavioural plasticity), as well as significant negative correlations between them for all behavioural parameters. Our results indicate that motor personality traits were connected with behavioural plasticity. Moreover, we revealed a significant positive correlation between the random slopes of (loco)motion duration and motion change frequency. This relationship could indicate some central plasticity of motor personality traits. In conclusion, negative correlations between the motor personality traits and the behavioural plasticity demonstrate expression of convergent tendency from both opposite trait values. This corresponds with different ideas on ability to compensate personality effects or to prepare for potential future conditions. In the laboratory, plasticity of personality traits take place whenever an animal is placed e. g. in a breeding box for the first time or is left for a long time in an experimental apparatus. Best practice standards for measuring analyte levels in saliva recommend that all biospecimens be tested in replicate with mean concentrations used in statistical analyses. This approach prioritizes minimizing laboratory-based measurement error but, in the process, expends considerable resources. We explore the possibility that, due to advances in salivary assay precision, the contribution of laboratory-based measurement error in salivary analyte data is very small relative to more important and meaningful variability in analyte levels across biological replicates (i.e., between different specimens). To evaluate this possibility, we examine the utility of the repeatability intra-class correlation (rICC) as an additional index of salivary analyte data precision. Using randomly selected subsamples (Ns=200 and 60) of salivary analyte data collected as part of a larger epidemiologic study, we compute the rICCs for seven commonly assayed salivary measures in biobehavioral research - cortisol, alpha-amylase, c-reactive protein, interlekin-6, uric acid, secretory immunoglobulin A, and testosterone. We assess the sensitivity of rICC estimates to assay type and the unique distributions of the underlying analyte data. We also use simulations to examine the bias, precision, and coverage probability of rICC estimates calculated for small to large sample sizes. For each analyte, the rICCs revealed that less than 5\% of variation in analyte levels was attributable to laboratory-based measurement error. rICC estimates were similar across all analytes despite differences in analyte levels, average intra-assay coefficients of variation, and in the distributional properties of the data. Guidelines for calculating rICC are provided to enable investigators and laboratory staff to apply this metric and more accurately quantify, and communicate, the magnitude of laboratory-based measurement error in their data. By helping investigators scale measurement error relative to more scientifically meaningful variability between biological replicates, the application of the rICC has the potential to influence research strategies and tactics such that resources (e.g., finances, effort, number/volume of biospecimens) are allocated more efficiently and effectively.},

In parallel, many Theories of Consciousness (ToCs) have been proposed. These theories are diverse in nature, ranging from computational to neurophysiological and quantum theoretical approaches. This contrasts with other fields of natural science, which host a smaller number of competing theories. We suggest that one reason for this abundance of extremely different theories may be the lack of stringent criteria specifying how empirical data constrains ToCs. First, we argue that consciousness is a well-defined topic from an empirical point of view and motivate a purely empirical stance on the quest for consciousness. Second, we present a checklist of criteria that, we propose, empirical ToCs need to cope with. Third, we review 13 of the most influential ToCs and subject them to the criteria. Our analysis helps to situate these different ToCs in the theoretical landscapeand sheds light on their strengths and weaknesses from a strictly empirical point of view.},

When an observer translates without moving the eyes, the retinal speed of a stationary object is related to its distance by a scale factor that depends on the velocity of the observer's self-motion. Here, we aim to test whether the brain uses vestibular cues to selfmotion to estimate distance to stationary surfaces in the environment. This relationship was systematically probed using a two-alternative forced-choice task in which distance perceived from monocular image motion during passive body translation was compared to distance perceived from binocular disparity while subjects were stationary. We show that perceived distance from motion depended on both observer velocity and retinal speed. For a given head speed, slower retinal speeds led to the perception of farther distances. Likewise, for a given retinal speed, slower head speeds led to the perception of nearer distances. However, these relationships were weak in some subjects and absent in others, and distance estimated from self-motion and retinal image motion was substantially compressed relative to distance estimated from binocular disparity. Overall, our findings suggest that the combination of retinal image motion and vestibular signals related to head velocity can provide a rudimentary capacity for distance estimation. \textcopyright{} ARVO.},

  abstract = {Photic history, including the relative duration of day versus night in a 24-hour cycle, is known to influence subsequent circadian responses to light in mammals. Whether such modulation is present in Drosophila is currently unknown. To date, all photic phase-response curves (PRCs) generated from Drosophila have done so with animals housed under seasonally agnostic equatorial photoperiods with alternating 12-hour segments of light and darkness. However, the genus contains thousands of species, some of which populate high and low-latitude habitats (20-50\textdegree{} north or south of the Equator) where seasonal variations in the light-dark schedule are pronounced. Here, we address this disconnect by constructing the first high-resolution Drosophila seasonal atlas for light-induced circadian phase-resetting. Testing the light responses of over 4,000 Drosophila at 120 timepoints across 5 seasonally-relevant rectangular photoperiods (i.e., LD 8:16, 10:14, 12:12, 14:10, and 16:8; 24 hourly intervals surveyed in each), we determined that many aspects of the fly circadian PRC waveform are conserved with increasing daylength. Surprisingly though, irrespective of LD schedule, the start of the PRCs always remained anchored to the timing of subjective sunset, creating a differential overlap of the advance zone with the morning hours after subjective sunrise that was maximized under summer photoperiods and minimized under winter photoperiods. These data suggest that there may be differences in flies versus mammals as to how the photoperiod modulates the waveform and amplitude of the circadian PRC to light. On the other hand, they support the possibility that the lights-off transition determines the phase-positioning of photic PRCs across seasons and across species. More work is necessary to test this claim and whether it might factor into the timing of seasonal light responses in humans.},

  abstract = {Neural oscillations are ubiquitous across recording methodologies and species, broadly associated with cognitive tasks, and amenable to computational modelling that investigates neural circuit generating mechanisms and neural population dynamics. Because of this, neural oscillations offer an exciting potential opportunity for linking theory, physiology and mechanisms of cognition. However, despite their prevalence, there are many concerns\textemdash new and old\textemdash about how our analysis assumptions are violated by known properties of field potential data. For investigations of neural oscillations to be properly interpreted, and ultimately developed into mechanistic theories, it is necessary to carefully consider the underlying assumptions of the methods we employ. Here, we discuss seven methodological considerations for analysing neural oscillations. The considerations are to (1) verify the presence of oscillations, as they may be absent; (2) validate oscillation band definitions, to address variable peak frequencies; (3) account for concurrent non-oscillatory aperiodic activity, which might otherwise confound measures; measure and account for (4) temporal variability and (5) waveform shape of neural oscillations, which are often bursty and/or nonsinusoidal, potentially leading to spurious results; (6) separate spatially overlapping rhythms, which may interfere with each other; and (7) consider the required signal-to-noise ratio for obtaining reliable estimates. For each topic, we provide relevant examples, demonstrate potential errors of interpretation, and offer suggestions to address these issues. We primarily focus on univariate measures, such as power and phase estimates, though we discuss how these issues can propagate to multivariate measures. These considerations and recommendations offer a helpful guide for measuring and interpreting neural oscillations.},

Emerging evidence demonstrates that the aperiodic component has putative physiological interpretations and that it dynamically changes with age, task demands and cognitive states. Electrophysiological neural activity is typically analyzed using canonically defined frequency bands, without consideration of the aperiodic (1/f-like) component. We show that standard analytic approaches can conflate periodic parameters (center frequency, power, bandwidth) with aperiodic ones (offset, exponent), compromising physiological interpretations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an algorithm to parameterize neural power spectra as a combination of an aperiodic component and putative periodic oscillatory peaks. This algorithm requires no a priori specification of frequency bands. We validate this algorithm on simulated data, and demonstrate how it can be used in applications ranging from analyzing age-related changes in working memory to large-scale data exploration and analysis.},

  abstract = {Proportional data, in which response variables are expressed as percentages or fractions of a whole, are analysed in many subfields of ecology and evolution. The scale-independence of proportions makes them appropriate to analyse many biological phenomena, but statistical analyses are not straightforward, since proportions can only take values from zero to one and their variance is usually not constant across the range of the predictor. Transformations to overcome these problems are often applied, but can lead to biased estimates and difficulties in interpretation. In this paper, we provide an overview of the different types of proportional data and discuss the different analysis strategies available. In particular, we review and discuss the use of promising, but little used, techniques for analysing continuous (also called non-count-based or non-binomial) proportions (e.g. percent cover, fraction time spent on an activity): beta and Dirichlet regression, and some of their most important extensions. A major distinction can be made between proportions arising from counts and those arising from continuous measurements. For proportions consisting of two categories, count-based data are best analysed using well-developed techniques such as logistic regression, while continuous proportions can be analysed with beta regression models. In the case of {$>$}2 categories, multinomial logistic regression or Dirichlet regression can be applied. Both beta and Dirichlet regression techniques model proportions at their original scale, which makes statistical inference more straightforward and produce less biased estimates relative to transformation-based solutions. Extensions to beta regression, such as models for variable dispersion, zero-one augmented data and mixed effects designs have been developed and are reviewed and applied to case studies. Finally, we briefly discuss some issues regarding model fitting, inference, and reporting that are particularly relevant to beta and Dirichlet regression. Beta regression and Dirichlet regression overcome some problems inherent in applying classic statistical approaches to proportional data. To facilitate the adoption of these techniques by practitioners in ecology and evolution, we present detailed, annotated demonstration scripts covering all variations of beta and Dirichlet regression discussed in the article, implemented in the freely available language for statistical computing, r.},

The entraining process adjusts the period of the internal clock to 24 hours and its phase to a value that determines the organism's temporal niche (e.g., diurnal and nocturnal). For most vertebrates, the dominant environmental synchronizer is light. All vertebrates employ specialized photoreceptor cells to perceive synchronizing light signals, but mammals and nonmammalian vertebrates do this differently. Mammals concentrate circadian photoreceptors in the retina, employing rods, cones, and a subset of retinal ganglion cells that are directly photosensitive and contain an unusual photopigment (melanopsin). Nonmammalian vertebrates use photoreceptors located deep in the brain and in the pineal gland as well as others in the retina. Such photoreceptor extravagance is difficult to explain. It seems likely that the different photoreceptor classes in this elaborate sensory system may have specialized roles in entrainment. There is some evidence that this is in fact the case. Furthermore, this nonvisual ``circadian'' photoreceptive system also controls acute behavioral responses to light (masking), pupillary constriction, and photoperiodic regulation of reproductive state. We review some of the early work on birds and describe new findings that indicate specific roles for retinal rods, cones, and photosensitive retinal ganglion cells in mammals.},

  abstract = {The advantages of the model organism Drosophila melanogaster, including low genetic redundancy, functional simplicity, and the ability to conduct large-scale genetic screens, have been essential for understanding the molecular nature of circadian (\_24 hr) rhythms, and continue to be valuable in discovering novel regulators of circadian rhythms and sleep. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of these interrelated biological processes in Drosophila and the wider implications of this research. Clock genes period and timeless were first discovered in large-scale Drosophila genetic screens developed in the 1970s. Feedback of period and timeless on their own transcription forms the core of the molecular clock, and accurately timed expression, localization, post-transcriptional modification, and function of these genes is thought to be critical for maintaining the circadian cycle. Regulators, including several phosphatases and kinases, act on different steps of this feedback loop to ensure strong and accurately timed rhythms. Approximately 150 neurons in the fly brain that contain the core components of the molecular clock act together to translate this intracellular cycling into rhythmic behavior. We discuss how different groups of clock neurons serve different functions in allowing clocks to entrain to environmental cues, driving behavioral outputs at different times of day, and allowing flexible behavioral responses in different environmental conditions. The neuropeptide PDF provides an important signal thought to synchronize clock neurons, although the details of how PDF accomplishes this function are still being explored. Secreted signals from clock neurons also influence rhythms in other tissues. SLEEP is, in part, regulated by the circadian clock, which ensures appropriate timing of sleep, but the amount and quality of sleep are also determined by other mechanisms that ensure a homeostatic balance between sleep and wake. Flies have been useful for identifying a large set of genes, molecules, and neuroanatomic loci important for regulating sleep amount. Conserved aspects of sleep regulation in flies and mammals include wake-promoting roles for catecholamine neurotransmitters and involvement of hypothalamus-like regions, although other neuroanatomic regions implicated in sleep in flies have less clear parallels. Sleep is also subject to regulation by factors such as food availability, stress, and social environment. We are beginning to understand how the identified molecules and neurons interact with each other, and with the environment, to regulate sleep. Drosophila researchers can also take advantage of increasing mechanistic understanding of other behaviors, such as learning and memory, courtship, and aggression, to understand how sleep loss impacts these behaviors. Flies thus remain a valuable tool for both discovery of novel molecules and deep mechanistic understanding of sleep and circadian rhythms.},

However, circadian pacemakers have to be sensitive to environmental cues to be beneficial.

To be successful, they require a continuous transformation of stimulus location into a corresponding motor pattern or selection and blending of a subset of cardinal motor patterns. Tactile stimulation of one forewing of a locust elicits characteristic grooming movements of the ipsilateral hind leg. An initial targeted trajectory that moves the tarsus toward the site of stimulation is followed by a cyclic trajectory in the region of the stimulus. We have analyzed both components of this behavior to quantify the relative effects of somatotopic stimulus position and leg start posture on three parameters: initial movement direction, accuracy, and grooming distribution. Accuracy and grooming distribution were significantly affected by the stimulus location but were not influenced by the initial leg posture. Both cues systematically shifted the initial movement direction from the onset of the response. The subsequent cyclic component of grooming movements forms a behavioral continuum with no clustering in joint angle space. We therefore conclude that forewing grooming in locusts is generated by a single movement pattern that is continuously shifted by a sensory cue signaling position on the forewing surface. Both vertebrates and invertebrates can switch between distinct movement forms to groom different parts of their bodies. Our data provide the first evidence that invertebrates, like vertebrates, also have graded control of limb targeting within the somatosensory receptive field of a single form of motor response.},

Foragers (typically older than 21 days) have strong circadian rhythms; they are active during the day, and sleep during the night. We explored whether young bees ({$\sim$}3 days of age), which are typically active around-the-clock with no circadian rhythms, also exhibit sleep behavior. We combined 24-hour video recordings, detailed behavioral observations, and analyses of response thresholds to a light pulse for individually housed bees in various arousal states. We characterized three sleep stages in foragers on the basis of differences in body posture, bout duration, antennae movements and response threshold. Young bees exhibited sleep behavior consisting of the same three stages as observed in foragers. Sleep was interrupted by brief awakenings, which were as frequent in young bees as in foragers. Beyond these similarities, we found differences in the sleep architecture of young bees and foragers. Young bees passed more frequently between the three sleep stages, and stayed longer in the lightest sleep stage than foragers. These differences in sleep architecture may represent developmental and/or environmentally induced variations in the neuronal network underlying sleep in honeybees. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evidence for plasticity in sleep behavior in insects.},

We focus on two complementary model insects, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, which is amenable to extensive transgenic manipulations, and the honey bee Apis mellifera, which has rich and well-studied social behaviors. Social entrainment of activity rhythms (social synchronization) has been studied in many animals. Social time givers appear to be specifically important in dark cavity-dwelling social animals, but here there are no other clear relationships between the degree of sociality and the effectiveness of social entrainment. The olfactory system is important for social entrainment in insects. Little is known, however, about the molecular and neuronal pathways linking olfactory neurons to the central clock. In the honey bee, the expression, phase, and development of circadian rhythms are socially regulated, apparently by different signals. Peripheral clocks regulating pheromone synthesis and the olfactory system have been implicated in social influences on circadian rhythms in the fruit fly. An enriched social environment increases the total amount of sleep in both fruit flies and honey bees. In fruit flies, these changes have been linked to molecular and neuronal processes involved in learning, memory, and synaptic plasticity. The studies on insects suggest that social influences on the clock are richer than previously appreciated and have led to important breakthroughs in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying social influences on sleep and circadian rhythms. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Honey bees provide an excellent model system in this regard because their behavioral repertoire is well characterized and the environment they experience during the day can be manipulated while keeping an ecologically and sociobiologically relevant context. We examined whether social experience modulates sleep in honey bees, and evaluated the relative contribution of different social signals. We exposed newly emerged bees to different components of their natural social environment and then monitored their sleep behavior in individual cages in a constant lab environment. We found that rich waking experience modulates subsequent sleep. Bees that experienced the colony environment for 1 or 2 days slept more than same-age sister bees that were caged individually or in small groups in the lab. Furthermore, bees placed in mesh-enclosures in the colony, that prevented direct contact with nestmates, slept similarly to bees freely moving in the colony. These results suggest that social signals that do not require direct or close distance interactions between bees are sufficiently rich to encompass almost the entire effect of the colony on sleep. Our findings provide a remarkable example of social experience-dependent modulation of an essential biological process.},

They rely on spatial information that is contained in the retinal motion patterns induced on the eyes while moving around ("optic flow") to accomplish their extraordinary performance. Thereby, they employ an active flight and gaze strategy that separates rapid saccade-like turns from translatory flight phases where the gaze direction is kept largely constant. This behavioral strategy facilitates the processing of environmental information, because information about the distance of the animal to objects in the environment is only contained in the optic flow generated by translatory motion. However, motion detectors as are widespread in biological systems do not represent veridically the velocity of the optic flow vectors, but also reflect textural information about the environment. This characteristic has often been regarded as a limitation of a biological motion detection mechanism. In contrast, we conclude from analyses challenging insect movement detectors with image flow as generated during translatory locomotion through cluttered natural environments that this mechanism represents the contours of nearby objects. Contrast borders are a main carrier of functionally relevant object information in artificial and natural sceneries. The motion detection system thus segregates in a computationally parsimonious way the environment into behaviorally relevant nearby objects and-in many behavioral contexts-less relevant distant structures. Hence, by making use of an active flight and gaze strategy, insects are capable of performing extraordinarily well even with a computationally simple motion detection mechanism.},

The distance indicated in these waggle dances, judged by the number of wagging movements per wagrun, was the same regardless of whether individuals had to run an additional 3 m of tube after flight or not. The energy needed during walking after flight was determined by measuring O2 consumption. All individuals attempted to regulate their body temperatures between 36 and 42\textdegree C during walking and feeding (O2 consumption=40{$\mu$}l{$\cdot$}min-1 per bee). Calculations show that this walking through 3 m of tube requires as much energy as flying 128 m (difference between thoracic and ambient temperature=15\textdegree C).

  abstract = {Estimates of location or orientation can be constructed solely from sensory information representing environmental cues. In unfamiliar or sensory-poor environments, these estimates can also be maintained and updated by integrating self-motion information. However, the accumulation of error dictates that updated representations of heading direction and location become progressively less reliable over time, and must be corrected by environmental sensory inputs when available. Anatomical, electrophysiological and behavioural evidence indicates that angular and translational path integration contributes to the firing of head direction cells and grid cells. We discuss how sensory inputs may be combined with self-motion information in the firing patterns of these cells. For head direction cells, direct projections from egocentric sensory representations of distal cues can help to correct cumulative errors. Grid cells may benefit from sensory inputs via boundary vector cells and place cells. However, the allocentric code of boundary vector cells and place cells requires consistent head-direction information in order to translate the sensory signal of egocentric boundary distance into allocentric boundary vector cell firing, suggesting that the different spatial representations found in and around the hippocampal formation are interdependent. We conclude that, rather than representing pure path integration, the firing of head-direction cells and grid cells reflects the interface between self-motion and environmental sensory information. Together with place cells and boundary vector cells they can support a coherent unitary representation of space based on both environmental sensory inputs and path integration signals. Abstract figure legend Spatial navigation is thought to rely on complementary information from environmental sensory cues and an internal path integration system. An estimate of one's location within an environment can be constructed purely from environmental sensory information, however in sensory-poor environments (e.g. in the dark or far from geometrical cues) this estimate can also be maintained by integrating self-motion information, a process known as path integration (red dashed line). Path integration tracks changes in both the angular and translational components of movement, but is subject to drift over time due to the accumulation of error. Head direction cells (HDCs) and grid cells (GCs) are thought to represent the neural bases of these components and are known to be anchored to environmental cues, correcting for drift (mountain and purple arrows). Information on the distance to the boundaries of an environment is provided by boundary vector cells (BVCs).},

This is one of the great scientific challenges of our era, with huge implications not only for human health but for insight into all animal life and for the development of future technologies. How should resources be invested to foster the necessary leap toward understanding? Given the pressing societal need and the very high public expectations of neuroscience, stoked by TED talks, New York Times articles, and sci fi, the pressures riding on choices of funding targets are enormous. Against this background, 2013 was a banner year for the brain: both the European Union and the United States agreed to devote unprecedented support specifically to neuroscience. The European Union funded the billion-dollar Human Brain Project (HBP; Amunts et al, 2016), whose centerpiece was a team science effort to develop neuroinformatics infrastructure and to expand the Blue Brain Project (Markram, 2006), a high-fidelity biophysically realistic computational model of brain tissue. In the United States, the BRAIN Initiative launched with an initial commitment of \$100 million and the appointment of a panel of respected scientists who met over months to identify major gaps and promising directions in neuroscience (Jorgenson et al., 2015). Government agencies then formulated funding opportunities that supported individual labs or small teams to develop new technologies to record, stimulate, analyze, and interpret neural activity. These efforts stimulated brain initiatives in several other countries, including Japan, Korea, and China (Huang and Luo, 2015; Grillner et al., 2016). Almost 10 years later, it is timely to look back at some of the large-scale neuroscience efforts of the past decade and the routes they \ldots},

  abstract = {When making choices, collecting more information is beneficial but comes at the cost of sacrificing time that could be allocated to making other potentially rewarding decisions. To investigate how the brain balances these costs and benefits, we conducted a series of novel experiments in humans and simulated various computational models. Under six levels of time pressure, subjects made decisions either by integrating sensory information over time or by dynamically combining sensory and reward information over time. We found that during sensory integration, time pressure reduced performance as the deadline approached, and choice was more strongly influenced by the most recent sensory evidence. By fitting performance and reaction time with various models we found that our experimental results are more compatible with leaky integration of sensory information with an urgency signal or a decision process based on stochastic transitions between discrete states modulated by an urgency signal. When combining sensory and reward information, subjects spent less time on integration than optimally prescribed when reward decreased slowly over time, and the most recent evidence did not have the maximal influence on choice. The suboptimal pattern of reaction time was partially mitigated in an equivalent control experiment in which sensory integration over time was not required, indicating that the suboptimal response time was influenced by the perception of imperfect sensory integration. Meanwhile, during combination of sensory and reward information, performance did not drop as the deadline approached, and response time was not different between correct and incorrect trials. These results indicate a decision process different from what is involved in the integration of sensory information over time. Together, our results not only reveal limitations in sensory integration over time but also illustrate how these limitations influence dynamic combination of sensory and reward information.},

This video-based platform delivers positional and locomotion data, behavioral responsiveness to stimuli, sleep intensity measures and homeostatic regulation effects \textendash{} all in one combined system. We show how insight into dynamically changing arousal thresholds is crucial for any sleep study in flies. We first find that arousal probing uncovers different sleep intensity profiles among related genetic background strains previously assumed to have equivalent sleep patterns. We then show how sleep duration and sleep intensity can be uncoupled, with distinct manipulations of dopamine function producing opposite effects on sleep duration but similar sleep intensity defects. We conclude by providing a multi-dimensional assessment of combined arousal and locomotion metrics in the mutant and background strains. Our approach opens the door for deeper insights into mechanisms of sleep regulation and provides a new method for investigating the role of different genetic manipulations in controlling sleep and arousal.},

The importance of these observations is 3-fold. First, while to date only a single form of body-care-related tool use has been recorded in wild birds (anting), our finding shows that the wild avian tool-use repertoire is wider than previously thought and extends to contexts other than food extraction. Second, we expand the taxonomic breadth of tool use to include another group of birds, seabirds, and a different suborder (Lari). Third, our independent observations span a distance of more than 1,700 km, suggesting that occasional tool use may be widespread in this group, and that seabirds' physical cognition may have been underestimated.},

Here we show that Drosophila use their retinal muscles to smoothly track visual motion, which helps to stabilize the retinal image, and also to perform small saccades when viewing a stationary scene. We show that when the retina moves, visual receptive fields shift accordingly, and that even the smallest retinal saccades activate visual neurons. Using a head-fixed behavioural paradigm, we find that Drosophila perform binocular, vergence movements of their retinas\textemdash which could enhance depth perception\textemdash when crossing gaps, and impairing the physiology of retinal motor neurons alters gap-crossing trajectories during free behaviour. That flies evolved an ability to actuate their retinas suggests that moving the eye independently of the head is broadly paramount for animals. The similarities of smooth and saccadic movements of the Drosophila retina and the vertebrate eye highlight a notable example of convergent evolution.},

  abstract = {Wood ants are a model system for studying visual learning and navigation. They can forage for food and navigate to their nests effectively by forming memories of visual features in their surrounding environment. Previous studies of freely behaving ants have revealed many of the behavioural strategies and environmental features necessary for successful navigation. However, little is known about the exact visual properties of the environment that animals learn or the neural mechanisms that allow them to achieve this. As a first step towards addressing this, we developed a classical conditioning paradigm for visual learning in harnessed wood ants that allows us to control precisely the learned visual cues. In this paradigm, ants are fixed and presented with a visual cue paired with an appetitive sugar reward. Using this paradigm, we found that visual cues learnt by wood ants through Pavlovian conditioning are retained for at least 1 h. Furthermore, we found that memory retention is dependent upon the ants' performance during training. Our study provides the first evidence that wood ants can form visual associative memories when restrained. This classical conditioning paradigm has the potential to permit detailed analysis of the dynamics of memory formation and retention, and the neural basis of learning in wood ants.},

  abstract = {In the past century, insects have become models for studying associative learning and memory formation. Learning paradigms have been developed for several insect species and modalities, but they comprise only two main categories: classical and operant con- ditioning. While the same cues can be learnt in both paradigms, the process by which learning occurs differs on the extent to which animals need to interact with their envi- ronment to form a memory. Classical conditioned individuals obtain information about a cue and a reward/punishment passively while operant conditioned animals need perform an action to be rewarded/avoid punishment. Thus, to truly understand how memories are formed and stored in the brain, it becomes essential to identify to which extent self-action within the environment influences learning. Considering this, I have investigated memory formation in wood ants, Formica rufa, through classical conditioning and found that they are able to passively learn the associa- tion between a visual cue and a sugar reward. I have explored this paradigm to investigate particularities of this type of learning and showed that these memories can be lateralised, with short- and medium-term visual memories being formed after training with a rein- forcement of the right antenna and long-term memories with a reinforcement on the left antenna. Additionally, I have developed a paradigm in which wood ants can walk on an air supported ball in open- or closed-loop with a virtual world. To demonstrate this paradigm is functional, I have investigated the use of self-generated optic flow on the integration of distance, speed and time of walking ants. I found that ants display repeatable walk- ing behaviour that does not require but can be changed by variations of self-induced or external optic flow. This paradigm allows for a fully controlled comparison and analysis of active and passive interactions with a virtual environment on a tethered animal from which neural circuits could be accessible.},

To investigate the adaptive significance of sleep, we develop an evolutionary argument formulated as a tractable partial differential equation model. We allow demographic parameters such as birth and mortality rates to vary through time in both safe and vulnerable sleeping environments. From this model we analytically calculate population growth rate (fitness) for sleeping and non-sleeping strategies. We find that, in a temporally heterogeneous environment, sleep behavior always achieves a higher fitness than non-sleeping behavior. As organisms do not exist in constant environments, we conclude that the evolution of sleep is inevitable. Further, we suggest that the two contrasting theories need not be mutually exclusive.},

  abstract = {Desert ants (Cataglyphis) are famous insect navigators. During their foraging lives, the ants leave their underground colonies for long distances and return to their starting point with fair accuracy [1, 2]. Their incessantly running path integrator provides them with a continually updated home vector [3?5]. Directional input to their path integrator is provided by a visual compass based on celestial cues [6, 7]. However, as path integration is prone to cumulative errors, the ants additionally employ landmark guidance routines [8?11]. At the start of their foraging lives, they acquire the necessary landmark information by performing well-structured learning walks [12, 13], including turns about their vertical body axes [14]. When Cataglyphis noda performs these pirouettes, it always gazes at the nest entrance during the longest of several short stopping phases [14]. As the small nest entrance is not visible, the ants can adjust their gaze direction only by reading out their path integrator. However, recent experiments have shown that, for adjusting the goal-centered gaze directions during learning walks, skylight cues are not required [15]. A most promising remaining compass cue is the geomagnetic field, which is used for orientation in one way or the other by a variety of animal species [16?25]. Here, we show that the gaze directions during the look-back-to-the-nest behavior change in a predictable way to alterations of the horizontal component of the magnetic field. This is the first demonstration that, in insects, a geomagnetic compass cue is both necessary and sufficient for accomplishing a well-defined navigational task.},

Two hundred and seventy-five fastball pitches were captured at 240 Hz simultaneously with a 9-camera marker-less system and a 12-camera marker system. The pitches were thrown by 30 baseball pitchers (age 17.1 {$\pm$} 3.1 years). Data for each trial were time-synchronised between the two systems using the instant of ball release. Coefficients of Multiple Correlations (CMC) were computed to assess the similarity of waveforms between the two systems. Discrete measurements at foot contact, during arm cocking, and at ball release were compared between the systems using Bland-Altman plots and descriptive statistics. CMC values for the five time series analysed ranged from 0.88 to 0.97, indicating consistency in movement patterns between systems. Biases for discrete measurements ranged in magnitude from 0 to 16 degrees. Standard deviations of the differences between systems ranged from 0 to 14 degrees, while intraclass correlations ranged from 0.64 to 0.92. Thus, the marker-based and marker-less motion capture systems produced similar patterns for baseball pitching kinematics. However, based on the variations between the systems, it is recommended that a database of normative ranges be established for each system.},

The movement of plants or plant parts occurs over a wide range of sizes and time scales. This review summarizes the main physical mechanisms plants use to achieve motility, highlighting recent work at the frontier of biology and physics on rapid movements. Emphasis is given to presenting in a single framework pioneering biological studies of water transport and growth with more recent physics research on poroelasticity and mechanical instabilities. First, the basic osmotic and hydration/dehydration motors are described that contribute to movement by growth and reversible swelling/shrinking of cells and tissues. The speeds of these water-driven movements are shown to be ultimately limited by the transport of water through the plant body. Some plant structures overcome this hydraulic limit to achieve much faster movement by using a mechanical instability. The principle is to impose an 'energy barrier' to the system, which can originate from geometrical constraint or matter cohesion, allowing elastic potential energy to be stored until the barrier is overcome, then rapidly transformed into kinetic energy. Three of these rapid motion mechanisms have been elucidated recently and are described here: the snapping traps of two carnivorous plants, the Venus flytrap and Utricularia, and the catapult of fern sporangia. Finally, movement mechanisms are reconsidered in the context of the timescale of important physiological processes at the cellular and molecular level.},

  abstract = {Behavioural and brain left\textendash right asymmetries are a common feature among the animal kingdom. Lateralization often manifests itself at the population-level with most individuals showing the same direction of lateral bias. Theoretical model based on evolutionary stable strategy predicts that lateralization at the population-level is more likely to characterize social rather than solitary species. Empirical data supporting this hypothesis has been recently obtained in Hymenoptera showing that eusocial honeybees present an asymmetrical use of the antennae: the right antenna is involved in olfactory learning and present more olfactory receptors. However, no evidences about the role of antennal asymmetries in social interactions have been provided so far. Highly social ant species belonging to Formica rufa group are a good model for investigating natural communication because they are able to pass exact information to their nest mates. We applied the ``binary tree'' experimental paradigm, which allowed us to observe different types of antennal contacts performed by ants out of their nest. To examine possible asymmetrical use of the right and left antenna, we focused on ``feeding'' (the simplest) contacts where a ``donor'' ant is exchanging food with a ``receiver'' ant through trophallaxis. We observed a population-level asymmetry, with the ``receiver'' ant using the right antenna significantly more often than the left antenna. This study provides the first evidence of lateralization in antennal contacts in ants, and seems to support the hypothesis of mathematical models on the evolution of lateralization suggesting that the alignment of lateralization at the population-level matters in social interactions.},

  abstract = {Adaptive agents must occupy a limited repertoire of states and therefore minimize the long-term average of surprise associated with sensory exchanges with the world. Minimizing surprise enables them to resist a natural tendency to disorder.Surprise rests on predictions about sensations, which depend on an internal generative model of the world. Although surprise cannot be measured directly, a free-energy bound on surprise can be, suggesting that agents minimize free energy by changing their predictions (perception) or by changing the predicted sensory inputs (action).Perception optimizes predictions by minimizing free energy with respect to synaptic activity (perceptual inference), efficacy (learning and memory) and gain (attention and salience). This furnishes Bayes-optimal (probabilistic) representations of what caused sensations (providing a link to the Bayesian brain hypothesis).Bayes-optimal perception is mathematically equivalent to predictive coding and maximizing the mutual information between sensations and the representations of their causes. This is a probabilistic generalization of the principle of efficient coding (the infomax principle) or the minimum-redundancy principle.Learning under the free-energy principle can be formulated in terms of optimizing the connection strengths in hierarchical models of the sensorium. This rests on associative plasticity to encode causal regularities and appeals to the same synaptic mechanisms as those underlying cell assembly formation.Action under the free-energy principle reduces to suppressing sensory prediction errors that depend on predicted (expected or desired) movement trajectories. This provides a simple account of motor control, in which action is enslaved by perceptual (proprioceptive) predictions.Perceptual predictions rest on prior expectations about the trajectory or movement through the agent's state space. These priors can be acquired (as empirical priors during hierarchical inference) or they can be innate (epigenetic) and therefore subject to selective pressure.Predicted motion or state transitions realized by action correspond to policies in optimal control theory and reinforcement learning. In this context, value is inversely proportional to surprise (and implicitly free energy), and rewards correspond to innate priors that constrain policies.},

This conclusion is based on the following arguments: if the coupling among an ensemble of dynamical systems is mediated by short-range forces, then the states of remote systems must be conditionally independent. These independencies induce a Markov blanket that separates internal and external states in a statistical sense. The existence of a Markov blanket means that internal states will appear to minimize a free energy functional of the states of their Markov blanket. Crucially, this is the same quantity that is optimized in Bayesian inference. Therefore, the internal states (and their blanket) will appear to engage in active Bayesian inference. In other words, they will appear to model\textemdash and act on\textemdash their world to preserve their functional and structural integrity, leading to homoeostasis and a simple form of autopoiesis.},

We demonstrate the experimental power of this approach by example of a 'one-parameter open loop' testing paradigm. It provided (1) a straightforward measure of transient responses in presence of open loop visual stimulation; (2) high data throughput and standardized measurement conditions from process automation; and (3) simplified data analysis due to well-defined testing conditions. Being based on standard hardware and software techniques, our methods provide an affordable, easy to replicate and general solution for a broad range of behavioral applications in freely moving animals.

Classic experiments in tethered insects applied rigorous system identification techniques for the analysis of turning reactions in the presence of rotating pattern stimuli delivered in open-loop. However, the functional relevance of these measurements for visual free-flight control remains equivocal due to the largely unknown effects of the highly constrained experimental conditions. To perform a systems analysis of the visual flight speed response under free-flight conditions, we implemented a 'one-parameter open-loop' paradigm using 'TrackFly' in a wind tunnel equipped with real-time tracking and virtual reality display technology. Upwind flying flies were stimulated with sine gratings of varying temporal and spatial frequencies, and the resulting speed responses were measured from the resulting flight speed reactions. To control flight speed, the visual system of the fruit fly extracts linear pattern velocity robustly over a broad range of spatio-temporal frequencies. The speed signal is used for a proportional control of flight speed within locomotor limits. The extraction of pattern velocity over a broad spatio-temporal frequency range may require more sophisticated motion processing mechanisms than those identified in flies so far. In Drosophila, the neuromotor pathways underlying flight speed control may be suitably explored by applying advanced genetic techniques, for which our data can serve as a baseline. Finally, the high-level control principles identified in the fly can be meaningfully transferred into a robotic context, such as for the robust and efficient control of autonomous flying micro air vehicles.},

Mechanosensory feedback from the fly's `gyroscope' complements visual cues to terminate saccades, as well as to stabilize forward flight. Olfactory stimuli elicit tonic increases in wingbeat amplitude and frequency but do not alter the time course or magnitude of visual reflexes.}

Here, we show that the focal brood types being taken care of (i.e. egg, larva and pupa) have significant effects on individual activity/rest rhythm, using the monomorphic ant Diacamma (putative species indicum). When isolated from a colony, nurses exhibited a clear circadian rhythm. However, when paired with eggs or larvae, they exhibited around-the-clock activity with no apparent rhythm. In contrast, a clear activity rhythm emerged when nurses were paired with a pupa, requiring little care. Such brood-type-specific changes in circadian activity are considered to arise from the difference in caretaking demands. Our finding may contribute to the understanding of the organization of a colony in the context of behavioural variability under different microenvironments.},

  abstract = {Social insect colonies are highly organized systems, where communication among nestmates (i.e., social interactions) has a pivotal function for colonial organization. In order to further the understanding of social organization, the chronobiological system of social insect species, particularly their circadian rhythm, has recently attracted much attention. However, gaps still remain in our understanding of how individual active/rest rhythms are governed in various social contexts. In this study, we investigate the effects of worker-worker interactions on circadian activity rhythms, using the monomorphic ant, Diacamma sp. Continuous tracking of solitary ants elucidated circadian activity rhythms, both in young and old workers ({$<$}\,30~days and {$>$}\,70~days after eclosion, respectively). The color tag\textendash based automatic tracking of multiple workers revealed that young-old interactions reduced circadian rhythmic activities in both young and old workers, whereas young workers retained active/rest rhythms under young-young worker interactions. Together with the analyses of worker-worker interaction frequencies, we conclude that interactions between workers in different age groups (i.e., workers with different tasks) function as different cues to alter worker active/rest patterns. We discuss the potential roles of worker-worker interactions on the chronobiological organization of the ant society.},

  abstract = {Circadian rhythms, which respond to the day-night cycle on the earth, arise from the endogenous timekeeping system within organisms, called the ``biological clock.'' For accurate circadian rhythms, daily fluctuations in light and temperature are considered one of the important time cues. In social insects, both abiotic and biotic factors (i.e., social interactions) play a significant role in activity-rest rhythm regulation. However, it is challenging to monitor individual activity-rest rhythms in a colony because of the large group size and small body size. Therefore, it is unclear whether individuals in a colony exhibit activity-rest rhythms and how social interactions regulate their activity-rest rhythms in the colony. This study developed an image-based tracking system using 2D barcodes for Diacamma cf. indicum from Japan (a monomorphic ant) and measured the locomotor activities of all colony members under laboratory colony conditions. We also investigated the effect of broods on activity-rest rhythms by removing all broods under colony conditions. Activity-rest rhythms appeared only in isolated ants, not under colony conditions. In addition, workers showed arrhythmic activities after brood removal. These results suggested that a mixture of social interactions, and not light and temperature, induces the loss of activity-rest rhythms. These results contribute to the knowledge of a diverse pattern of circadian activity rhythms in social insects.},

We found that a population of Drosophila neurons that were sensitive to visual flow patterns typically generated during locomotion, the horizontal system (HS) cells, encoded unambiguous quantitative information about the fly's walking behavior independently of vision. Angular and translational velocity signals were integrated with a behavioral-state signal and generated direction-selective and speed-sensitive graded changes in the membrane potential of these non-spiking cells. The nonvisual direction selectivity of HS cells cooperated with their visual selectivity only when the visual input matched that expected from the fly's movements, thereby revealing a circuit for internally monitoring voluntary walking. Furthermore, given that HS cells promoted leg-based turning, the activity of these cells could be used to control forward walking.},

The horizontal velocity decreased riming the first half of each take-off and increased during the second half.

The vertical velocity increased at an almost constant rate during each take-off. The maximum height of the center of gravity was similar during the llights in the hop and the jump, and in the step it was approximately 10\% lower than in the hop and the jump. The mechanical energy decreased after each take-off. Four percent of the mechanical energy acquired during the run-up was lost during take-off for the hop.

Tendon elongation is often considered to be the primary factor for this force potentiation. However, direct examination of the influence of tendon elongation on the SSC effect has not been made. The aim of this study was to evaluate the contribution of tendon elongation to the SSC effect by comparing the magnitude of the SSC effect in the rat soleus with and without the Achilles tendon. The rat soleus was subjected to concentric contractions without pre-activation (CON) and concentric contractions with an eccentric pre-activation (ECC). For the `with-tendon' condition, the calcaneus was rigidly fixed to a force transducer, while for the `without-tendon' condition, the soleus was fixed at the muscle\textendash tendon junction. The SSC effect was calculated as the ratio of the mechanical work done during the concentric phase for the ECC and the CON conditions. Substantial and similar (P=0.167) SSC effects were identified for the with-tendon (318{$\pm$}86\%) and the without-tendon conditions (271{$\pm$}70\%). The contribution of tendon elongation to the SSC effect was negligible for the rat soleus. Other factors, such as pre-activation and residual force enhancement, may cause the large SSC effects and need to be evaluated.},

The thermal independence of the minimum cost of locomotion (Cmin), the low thermal dependence of VO2ss (i.e., y-intercept of the VO2ss versus speed function), and a typical Q10 of 2.0 for VO2max combined to increase MAS and endurance in B. discoidalis when T awas increased from 15 to 23\dbend C. Exerciserelated endothermy enabled running cockroaches to attain a greater VO2max, metabolic scope, and endurance capacity at 23\dbend C than would be possible if T tss remained equal to T a.

The use of color tags, a well-established and robust method for marking individual insects in groups, relaxes requirements for image size and quality, and makes the software broadly applicable. anTraX is readily integrated into existing tools and methods for automated image analysis of behavior to further augment its output. anTraX can handle large-scale experiments with minimal human involvement, allowing researchers to simultaneously monitor many social groups over long time periods.}

We recorded from populations of neurons in premotor, primary motor and somatosensory cortices as monkeys performed a reaching task, for up to 2 years. Intriguingly, despite a steady turnover in the recorded neurons, the low-dimensional latent dynamics remained stable. The stability allowed reliable decoding of behavioral features for the entire timespan, while fixed decoders based directly on the recorded neural activity degraded substantially.

It can handle a changing number of deformable objects in a region of interest, and is particularly suitable for animal and cell tracking in two-dimensions. Furthermore, we introduce the probability of incursions as a new measure of a movie's trackability that doesn't require the knowledge of ground truth trajectories, since it is resilient to small amounts of errors and can be computed on the basis of an ad hoc tracking. We also leveraged the versatility and speed of FastTrack to implement an iterative algorithm determining a set of nearly-optimized tracking parameters \textemdash yet further reducing the amount of human intervention\textemdash and demonstrate that FastTrack can be used to explore the space of tracking parameters to optimize the number of swaps for a batch of similar movies.

  abstract = {Humans have evolved the ability to walk very efficiently. Further, humans prefer to walk at speeds that approximately minimize their metabolic energy expenditure per unit distance (i.e. gross cost of transport, COT). This has been found in a variety of population groups and other species. However, these studies were mostly performed on smooth, level ground or on treadmills. We hypothesized that the objective function for walking is more complex than only minimizing the COT. To test this idea, we compared the preferred speeds and the relationships between COT and speed for people walking on both a smooth, level floor and a rough, natural terrain trail. Rough terrain presumably introduces other factors, such as stability, to the objective function. 10 healthy men walked on both a straight, flat, smooth floor and on an outdoor trail strewn with rocks and boulders. In both locations, subjects performed 5-7 trials at different speeds relative to their preferred speed. The COT-speed relationships were similarly U-shaped for both surfaces, but the COT values on rough terrain were approximately 115\% greater. On the smooth surface, the preferred speed (1.24+/-0.17 m/sec) was found to be statistically not different (p-value =0.09) than the speed that minimized COT (1.34 +/- 0.03 m/sec). On rough terrain, the preferred speed (1.07+/-0.05 m/sec) was slower than the COT minimum speed (1.13 +/- 0.07 m/sec) and was statistical significant (p-value=0.02). Since near the optimum speed the COT function is very shallow, these changes in speed result in small change in COT (0.5\%). It appears that the objective function for speed preference when walking on rough terrain includes COT and additional factors such as stability.},

  abstract = {Although it is well established that during periods of torpor heterothermic mammals and birds can reduce metabolic rates (MR) substantially, the mechanisms causing the reduction of MR remain a controversial subject. The comparative analysis provided here suggests that MR reduction depends on patterns of torpor used, the state of torpor, and body mass. Daily heterotherms, which are species that enter daily torpor exclusively, appear to rely mostly on the fall of body temperature (Tb) for MR reduction, perhaps with the exception of very small species and at high torpor Tb, where some metabolic inhibition may be used. In contrast, hibernators (species capable of prolonged torpor bouts) rely extensively on metabolic inhibition, in addition to Tb effects, to reduce MR to a fraction of that observed in daily heterotherms. In small hibernators, metabolic inhibition and the large fall of Tb are employed to maximize energy conservation, whereas in large hibernators, metabolic inhibition appears to be employed to facilitate MR and Tb reduction at torpor onset. Over the ambient temperature (Ta) range where torpid heterotherms are thermo-conforming, the Tb-Ta differential is more or less constant despite a decline of MR with Ta; however, in thermo-regulating torpid individuals, the Tb-Ta differential is maintained by a proportional increase of MR as during normothermia, albeit at a lower Tb. Thermal conductance in most torpid thermo-regulating individuals is similar to that in normothermic individuals despite the substantially lower MR in the former. However, conductance is low when deeply torpid animals are thermo-conforming probably because of peripheral vasoconstriction.},

We argue that the most successful forms of Bayesian statistics do not actually support that particular philosophy but rather accord much better with sophisticated forms of hypothetico-deductivism. We examine the actual role played by prior distributions in Bayesian models, and the crucial aspects of model checking and model revision, which fall outside the scope of Bayesian confirmation theory. We draw on the literature on the consistency of Bayesian updating and also on our experience of applied work in social science. Clarity about these matters should benefit not just philosophy of science, but also statistical practice. At best, the inductivist view has encouraged researchers to fit and compare models without checking them; at worst, theorists have actively discouraged practitioners from performing model checking because it does not fit into their framework.}

  abstract = {Background: Eccentric exercises have been used in physical training, injury prevention, and rehabilitation programs. The systematic use of eccentric training promotes specific morphological adaptations on skeletal muscles. However, synergistic muscles, such as the triceps surae components, might display different structural adaptations due to differences in architecture, function, and load sharing. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the effects of an eccentric training program on the triceps surae (GM, gastrocnemius medialis; GL, gastrocnemius lateralis; and SO, soleus) muscle architecture. Methods: Twenty healthy male subjects (26 {$\pm$} 4 years) underwent a 4-week control period followed by a 12-week eccentric training program. Muscle architecture [fascicle length (FL), pennation angle (PA), and muscle thickness (MT)] of GM, GL, and SO was evaluated every 4 weeks by ultrasonography. Results: Fascicle lengths (GM: 13.2\%; GL: 8.8\%; SO: 21\%) and ML increased (GM: 14.9\%; GL: 15.3\%; SO: 19.1\%) from pre- to post-training, whereas PAs remained similar. GM and SO FL and MT increased up to the 8th training week, whereas GL, FL increased up to the 4th week. SO displayed the highest, and GL the smallest gains in FL post-training. Conclusion: All three synergistic plantar flexor muscles increased FL and MT with eccentric training. MT increased similarly among the synergistic muscles, while the muscle with the shortest FL at baseline (SO) showed the greatest increase in FL.},

In addition, complex behaviors such as sun-compass orientation and time learning are clearly regulated by the circadian system in these organisms. Despite these unique features of social insect clocks, the mechanisms as well as the functional and evolutionary relevance of these traits remain largely unknown. Here we show a modification of the Drosophila activity monitoring (DAM) system that allowed us to measure locomotor rhythms of the honey bee, Apis mellifera (three variants; gAHB, carnica and caucasica), and two paper wasps (Polistes crinitus and Mischocyttarus phthisicus). A side-by-side comparison of the endogenous period under constant darkness (free-running period) led us to the realization that these social insects exhibit significant deviations from the Earth's 24 h rotational period as well as a large degree of inter-individual variation compared with Drosophila. Experiments at different temperatures, using honey bees as a model, revealed that testing the endogenous rhythm at 35\textdegree C, which is the hive's core temperature, results in average periods closer to 24 h compared with 25\textdegree C (23.8 h at 35\textdegree C versus 22.7 h at 25\textdegree C). This finding suggests that the degree of tuning of circadian temperature compensation varies among different organisms. We expect that the commercial availability, cost-effectiveness and integrated nature of this monitoring system will facilitate the growth of the circadian field in these social insects and catalyze our understanding of the mechanisms as well as the functional and evolutionary relevance of circadian rhythms.},

Over a single growing season, we collected Drosophila at regular intervals and determined the number of individuals of the nine species we found in Kansas, USA. Species varied in their presence and abundance through the growing season with peak diversity occurring after the highest seasonal temperatures. We developed models for the abundance of the most common species, Drosophila melanogaster, D. simulans, D. algonquin, and the recent invasive species, D. suzukii. These models revealed that temperature played the largest role in abundance of each species across the season. For the two most commonly studied species, D. melanogaster and D. simulans, the best models indicate shifted thermal optima compared to laboratory studies, implying that fluctuating temperature may play a greater role in the physiology and ecology of these insects than indicated by laboratory studies, and should be considered in global climate change studies.},

Even though this canonical division of labor is true for a number of neuronal types in the mammalian brain (including neocortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons or cerebellar Purkinje neurons), many neuronal types do not comply with this classical polarity scheme. In fact, dendrites can be the site of AP initiation and propagation, and even neurotransmitter release. In several interneuron types, all functions are carried out by dendrites as these neurons are devoid of a canonical axon. In this article, we present a few examples of ``misbehaving'' neurons (with a non-canonical polarity scheme) to highlight the diversity of solutions that are used by mammalian neurons to transmit information. Moreover, we discuss how the contribution of dendrites and axons to neuronal excitability may impose constraints on the morphology of these compartments in specific functional contexts.},

While mammals internally regulate BTR, ectotherms, including Drosophila, exhibit temperature preference rhythm (TPR) behavior to regulate BTR. Here, we demonstrate that the diuretic hormone 31 receptor (DH31R) mediates TPR during the active phase in Drosophila DH31R is expressed in clock cells, and its ligand, DH31, acts on clock cells to regulate TPR during the active phase. Surprisingly, the mouse homolog of DH31R, calcitonin receptor (Calcr), is expressed in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and mediates body temperature fluctuations during the active phase in mice. Importantly, DH31R and Calcr are not required for coordinating locomotor activity rhythms. Our results represent the first molecular evidence that BTR is regulated distinctly from locomotor activity rhythms and show that DH31R/Calcr is an ancient specific mediator of BTR during the active phase in organisms ranging from ectotherms to endotherms.},

However, some areas are still poorly studied and need to be developed. For instance, field studies focused on invertebrates are currently highly underrepresented in the literature. More studies including a wider variety of traits measured and species tested is needed to improve our understanding of trait-correlation patterns and generalities. We studied nine behavioural traits, in the damselfly Calopteryx splendens, from an array of three experiments: (i) courtship, (ii) aggressiveness and (iii) boldness, and calculated their repeatability. The behaviours were measured twice, in two different contexts: (i) undisturbed territory and (ii) partially deteriorated territory. All behavioural traits measured, except for two, were repeatable across the two contexts. This work demonstrates, for the first time, the presence of within population personality differences in an adult damselfly in the wild. We further propose Calopteryx splendens as a promising model species for testing personality in the wild under highly controlled environmental conditions.},

Here, we introduce a preparation that allows combining calcium imaging in efferent neurons with electrophysiological recordings of motor neuron activity in the stick insect thoracic nerve cord. The intracellular free calcium concentration in middle leg retractor coxae motor neurons and modulatory octopaminergic DUM neurons was monitored after backfilling lateral nerve nl5 that contains the axons of these neurons with the calcium indicator Oregon Green BAPTA-1. Rhythmic spike activity in retractor and protractor motor neurons was evoked by pharmacological activation of central pattern generating neuronal networks and recorded extracellularly from lateral nerves. A primary goal of this study was to investigate whether changes in the intracellular free calcium concentration observed in motor neurons during oscillatory activity depend on action potentials. We show that rhythmic spike activity in leg motor neurons induced either pharmacologically or by tactile stimulation of the animal is accompanied by a synchronous modulation in the intracellular free calcium concentration. Calcium oscillations in motor neurons do not appear to depend on calcium influx through voltage-sensitive calcium channels that are gated by action potentials because Calcium oscillations persist after pharmacologically blocking action potentials in the motor neurons. Calcium oscillations were also apparent in the modulatory DUM neurons innervating the same leg muscle. However, the timing of calcium oscillations varied not only between DUM neurons and motor neurons, but also among different DUM neurons. Therefore, we conclude that the motor neurons and the different DUM neurons receive independent central drive.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-{$\alpha$}-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD {$\leq$} 2.0 \AA{} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Six male subjects performed various vertical jumps with maximal effort: squat jumps (SJ), counter movement jumps (CMJ) and drop jumps (DJ) from a height of 24 cm, 40 cm and 56 cm. The force-length relationship was calculated from the signals of the components of the ground reaction forces and the kinematic data obtained from the high-speed film records. Surface electromyograms (EMG) of the soleus, gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles were also recorded. The force-length diagrams showed individually high sensitivity to the imposed stretch load. In conditions with relatively low stretch load requirements there was a counter-clockwise direction observable, indicating that the energy absorbed during the eccentric, or lengthening phase was lower than the energy delivered during the concentric, or shortening phase. In high load conditions this relationship was reversed indicating a negative energy balance. The EMG-length diagrams of SJ and CMJ consisted of an initial isometric loading of the muscle, followed by a shortening phase with only slightly reduced EMG amplitudes. In DJ, however, the diagrams showed an initial lengthening of the MTC with fairly constant activation amplitudes. After 40 ms an isometric loading of the muscle, lasting for approximately 80 ms, was followed by a shortening phase. It was concluded that segmental stretch reflex activation represented the predominant activation process during the isometric loading phase, to meet the adequate stiffness properties of the MTC. \textcopyright{} 1992 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract = {Surviving changing climate conditions is particularly difficult for organisms such as insects that depend on environmental temperature to regulate their physiological functions. Insects are extremely threatened by global warming, since many do not have enough physiological tolerance even to survive continuous exposure to the current maximum temperatures experienced in their habitats. Here, we review literature on the physiological mechanisms that regulate responses to heat and provide heat tolerance in insects: (i) neuronal mechanisms to detect and respond to heat; (ii) metabolic responses to heat; (iii) thermoregulation; (iv) stress responses to tolerate heat; and (v) hormones that coordinate developmental and behavioural responses at warm temperatures. Our review shows that, apart from the stress response mediated by heat shock proteins, the physiological mechanisms of heat tolerance in insects remain poorly studied. Based on life-history theory, we discuss the costs of heat tolerance and the potential evolutionary mechanisms driving insect adaptations to high temperatures. Some insects may deal with ongoing global warming by the joint action of phenotypic plasticity and genetic adaptation. Plastic responses are limited and may not be by themselves enough to withstand ongoing warming trends. Although the evidence is still scarce and deserves further research in different insect taxa, genetic adaptation to high temperatures may result from rapid evolution. Finally, we emphasize the importance of incorporating physiological information for modelling species distributions and ecological interactions under global warming scenarios. This review identifies several open questions to improve our understanding of how insects respond physiologically to heat and the evolutionary and ecological consequences of those responses. Further lines of research are suggested at the species, order and class levels, with experimental and analytical approaches such as artificial selection, quantitative genetics and comparative analyses.},

Turtle ants, Cephalotes varians, have distinct minor worker, soldier, and reproductive (gyne/queen) morphologies associated with their behavioral profiles: small-bodied task-generalist minors lack the phragmotic shield-shaped heads of soldiers, which are specialized to block and guard the nest entrance. Gynes found new colonies and during early stages of colony growth overlap behaviorally with soldiers. Here we describe patterns of brain structure and synaptic organization associated with division of labor in C. varians minor workers, soldiers, and gynes. We quantified brain volumes, determined scaling relationships among brain regions, and quantified the density and size of microglomeruli, synaptic complexes in the mushroom body calyxes important to higher-order processing abilities that may underpin behavioral performance. We found that brain volume was significantly larger in gynes; minor workers and soldiers had similar brain sizes. Consistent with their larger behavioral repertoire, minors had disproportionately larger mushroom bodies than soldiers and gynes. Soldiers and gynes had larger optic lobes, which may be important for flight and navigation in gynes, but serve different functions in soldiers. Microglomeruli were larger and less dense in minor workers; soldiers and gynes did not differ. Correspondence in brain structure despite differences in soldiers and gyne behavior may reflect developmental integration, suggesting that neurobiological metrics not only advance our understanding of brain evolution in social insects, but may also help resolve questions of the origin of novel castes.},

  abstract = {To study the behavior of Drosophila, it is often necessary to restrain and mount individual flies. This requires removal from food, additional handling, anesthesia, and physical restraint. We find a strong positive correlation between the length of time flies are mounted and their subsequent reflexive feeding response, where one hour of mounting is the approximate motivational equivalent to ten hours of fasting. In an attempt to explain this correlation, we rule out anesthesia side-effects, handling, additional fasting, and desiccation. We use respirometric and metabolic techniques coupled with behavioral video scoring to assess energy expenditure in mounted and free flies. We isolate a specific behavior capable of exerting large amounts of energy in mounted flies and identify it as an attempt to escape from restraint. We present a model where physical restraint leads to elevated activity and subsequent faster nutrient storage depletion among mounted flies. This ultimately further accelerates starvation and thus increases reflexive feeding response. In addition, we show that the consequences of the physical restraint profoundly alter aerobic activity, energy depletion, taste, and feeding behavior, and suggest that careful consideration is given to the time-sensitive nature of these highly significant effects when conducting behavioral, physiological or imaging experiments that require immobilization.},

  abstract = {Markerless 3D pose estimation has become an indispensable tool for kinematic studies of laboratory animals. Most current methods recover 3D pose by multi-view triangulation of deep network-based 2D pose estimates. However, triangulation requires multiple, synchronised cameras per keypoint and elaborate calibration protocols that hinder its widespread adoption in laboratory studies. Here, we describe LiftPose3D, a deep network-based method that overcomes these barriers by reconstructing 3D poses from a single 2D camera view. We illustrate LiftPose3D's versatility by applying it to multiple experimental systems using flies, mice, and macaque monkeys and in circumstances where 3D triangulation is impractical or impossible. Thus, LiftPose3D permits high-quality 3D pose estimation in the absence of complex camera arrays, tedious calibration procedures, and despite occluded keypoints in freely behaving animals.}

  abstract = {Apparent motion was simulated in the visual system of the tethered fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster by projecting moving stripe patterns onto stationary screens positioned in front of the lateral eye regions. The reactions of the animal were recorded under conditions of stationary flight in still air. It was found that visual stimulation modifies, independently, torque and thrust of the flight system. The responses appear suitable to counteract involuntary changes of direction and altitude in free flight. Concerning the sensory system for visual flight control, the following was established: 1. Both eyes are functionally equal, and sensitive to pattern motion in any direction. 2. The motion detecting subunits possess a certain orientation on the eye surface, and discriminate between pattern motions that are progressive or regressive relative to this orientation. 3. Progressive and regressive stimuli elicit opposite responses in the flight system. 4. The subunit orientations are expected to group in at least two different directions that share a common line of symmetry with the internal eye structure. 5. A minimum of two contralateral and two ipsilateral nerve connections between the visual system and the motor system is required for the various torque and thrust responses. Concerning the effect of pattern motion on the flight system, the following was found: 1. The motion detectors control only the magnitude of the force of flight. With the tethered animal in still air, the inclination of the force vector remains constant. 2. Consequently, the stroke plane and the wing pitch should be invariant to visual stimulation. 3. Possible influences of pattern motion on the wing-beat frequency were ruled out by frequency measurements. 4. The only major variables in wing articulation that respond to pattern motion are the wing-beat amplitudes on either side of the insect. In-flight photographs show that the difference and the sum of these amplitudes are, in fact, representative for the torque and the thrust of the flight system. The responses of the body posture may become important to flight performance at increased airspeed. Comparative experiments with the housefly Musca domestica indicate that the principle of independent torque and thrust control by vision is adopted in at least two different species. \textcopyright{} 1968 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract = {The common aim of the long and triple jumps is to attain maximum horizontal distance from the front of the take-off board. This is achieved by converting some of the horizontal velocity developed in the approach run into vertical velocity at take-off. The aim of this thesis was to examine a theoretical model and to identify kinematic and kinetic factors that facilitate the generation of vertical velocity in the long and triple jump take-offs. A pivot mechanism was defined to act between touch-down and the instant the centre of mass was directly above the toe of the support foot. This mechanism was found to be the largest contributor to the gain in vertical velocity in all take-offs, accounting for 83.0\% in the long jump and 63.7\%, 69.8\% and 70.7\% in the hop, step and jump take-offs. The contribution of the pivot to the gain in vertical velocity at take-off in the long jump was significantly greater than in each of the triple jump take-offs, (all P{$<$}0.002). A relative momentum approach was used to determine the contribution of the free limbs to the generation of vertical velocity. In the long jump, the free limbs made a 10.8\% contribution to the gain in vertical velocity, compared to 12.2\%, 19.0\% and 19.0\% in the triple jump take-offs. Multiple regression analyses were used to identify factors relating to the generation of vertical velocity in the long (n = 14). The greatest gains in vertical velocity were associated with techniques that emphasised a low centre of mass and extended knee joint at touch-down and the ability to resist knee flexion in the compression phase, R2=72.7\%. The greatest losses in horizontal velocity were associated with excessive hip adduction, less hip extension and greater increases in height from touch- down to take-ofll R2=84.5\%. Ground reaction forces and net joint moments were measured during short approach running jump tests. Peak vertical impact forces were greater in simulated `drop' take-offs, 5080 N, compared to those experienced in `flat' approach take-offs, 3250 N, (P=O. 002). Peak horizontal braking forces were 1800 N in both types of take-off. However, the peak net joint N. m and 249 N. m) were similar between the `flat' and `drop' take-offs. This suggests that moments about the ankle, (403 N. m and 387 N. m), knee (233 N. m and 296 N. m) and hip (292 athletes adapt their technique in the `drop' take-off to distribute the larger forces effectively about the ankle joint was particularly important in both types of take-off, but depending on the and to keep the net joint moments within controllable limits. Results indicated that strength joint at touch-down and maximum knee flexion were found to be associated with greater athlete's technique strength about the knee and hip are also vital. Greater flexion of the knee average knee moments, R2=30.8\% and 75.5\% respectively, and greater angles of leg placement were moderately associated with greater average hip moments, R2=23.5\%. In conclusion, this thesis has provided a greater insight into the kinetics and kinematics of jumping for distance. It has quantified the contribution made by the pivot mechanism and the In conclusion, this thesis has provided a greater insight into the kinetics and kinematics of skeletal system in terms of ground reaction forces and net joint moments. The results indicate that elite performers cannot rely on speed alone, and that strength and technique are major factors of successful performance.},

  abstract = {The long jump has been widely studied in recent years. Two models exist in the literature which define the relationship between selected variables that affect performance. Both models suggest that the critical phase of the long jump event is the touch-down to take-off phase, as it is in this phase that the necessary vertical velocity is generated. Many three dimensional studies of the long jump exist, but the only studies to have reported detailed data on this phase were two-dimensional in nature. In these, the poor relationships obtained between key variables and performance led to the suggestion that there may be some relevant information in data in the third dimension. The aims of this study were to conduct a three-dimensional analysis of the touch-down to take-off phase in the long jump and to explore the interrelationships between key variables. Fourteen male long jumpers were filmed using three-dimensional methods during the finals of the 1994 (n = 8) and 1995 (n = 6) UK National Championships. Various key variables for the long jump were used in a series of correlational and multiple regression analyses. The relationships between key variables when correlated directly one-to-one were generally poor. However, when analysed using a multiple regression approach, a series of variables was identified which supported the general principles outlined in the two models. These variables could be interpreted in terms of speed, technique and strength. We concluded that in the long jump, variables that are important to performance are interdependent and can only be identified by using appropriate statistical techniques. This has implications for a better understanding of the long jump event and it is likely that this finding can be generalized to other technical sports skills. \textcopyright{} 2005 Taylor \& Francis Group Ltd.},

  abstract = {Many insects have an innate propensity to approach conspicuous objects. We explore how such beacon aiming determines the shape of a wood ant's habitual route. We find that a single large black cylinder within an arena biases the route taken by ants as they run from a start position at one end of the arena to reach a feeder at the other. Ants learn a stable route with the first segment of their trajectory aimed at the cylinder, which becomes an intermediate goal on the way to the feeder. When in occasional tests the cylinder is removed or displaced, ants head for the usual site of the cylinder. They also aim for the same site when the cylinder is removed and the ant's normal start position is changed. This behaviour suggests that visual features of the arena are learnt from the vantage point of the cylinder and that this stored snapshot guides the ant to that site. Ants thus reinforce their ability to reach the cylinder by learning other visual features in their surroundings that can also steer them to its location. The use of beacon aiming in fixing routes has several benefits. Because the same path will be traversed on every trial, beacon aiming facilitates the acquisition of routes. Beacon aiming also increases the robustness of learnt routes: ants straying from the route will be attracted to the closest beacon and so regain their habitual paths.},

Nebria brevicollis and Calathus piceus were restricted to woodland litter, Abax parallelepipedus occurred in bracken and scrub usually found on the edge of woodland, and Pterostichus madidus was distributed in both woodland and grassland habitats. 3. The rate of dispersal and natural mortality in marked samples was such that only in Nebria brevicollis were detailed studies possible. In this species marking was responsible for disturbance dispersal in which the level of locomotor activity was increased, and during this dispersal some marked individuals moved from the litter area studied to another near by. 4. Apart from disturbance dispersal migration to and from the litter population was negligible, but it was concluded that there was constant movement within the population area by undisturbed N. brevicollis. It was therefore possible, during the autumn breeding activity in this species, to estimate populations by marking and recapture. 5. The number of N. brevicollis fell from 2300 in 1959 to 200 in 1960, and this change is tentatively related to a climatic factor, and the significance of climatic gradients on the edge of population areas is discussed.},

We analyze in 14 species, which range from purely olfactory to predominantly visually behaving ants, how the brains are equipped to control such behavior. We take the size and manifestation of the eyes as an indicator for the prevalence of vision in a given species, and we correlate it with the size of particular brain regions. Our morphometric data show that the size of the eyes generally correlates well with that of the optic lobes. The antennal lobes and the mushroom bodies have a surprisingly constant relative volume whereas, as expected, the relative size of the optic lobes varies strongly across species. Males of different species are more similar. Compared with workers, they all have large eyes, relatively larger optic lobes, smaller mushroom bodies, and similarly sized antennal lobes. The input regions of the mushroom bodies, the lip and the collar, generally correlate with the size of the optic and antennal lobe, respectively. Accordingly, the composition of the calyx reflects the importance of vision for the animal. We present data supporting the view that the mushroom bodies may participate in spatial orientation, landmark recognition, and visual information storage.},

Eighteen young healthy participants (mean age: 22.5 {$\pm$} 2.6) took part in the experiment. They were distributed into two groups: a control group (n = 9) and an MI training group (n = 9). The MI group performed seven consecutive sessions (one per day) of imagined maximal isometric plantar flexion (4 blocks of 25 trials per session). The control group did not engage in any physical or mental training. Both groups were tested for the isometric maximal plantar flexion torque (MVC) and the rate of torque development (RTD) before and after the training session. In addition, soleus and medial gastrocnemius spinal and supraspinal adaptations were assessed through the recording of H-reflexes and V-waves, with electrical stimulations of the posterior tibial nerve evoked at rest and during MVC, respectively. After one week, only the MI training group increased both plantar flexion MVC and RTD. The enhancement of muscle torque capacity was accompanied by significant increase of electromyographic activity and V-wave during MVC and of H-reflex at rest. The increased cortical descending neural drive and the excitability of spinal networks at rest could explain the greater RTD and MVC after one week of MI training.},

We find that previously identified attention and executive control systems are poised to affect a broad array of state transitions that cannot easily be classified by traditional engineering-based notions of control. This theoretical versatility comes with a vulnerability to injury. In patients with mild traumatic brain injury, we observe a loss of specificity in putative control processes, suggesting greater susceptibility to neurophysiological noise. These results offer fundamental insights into the mechanisms driving brain state transitions in healthy cognition and their alteration following injury.},

To defend their territories and threaten non-nestmate intruders, ants open their mandibles as a first aggressive display. Albeit chemical cues play a major role in discrimination between nestmates and non-nestmates, classical bioassays based on aggressive behaviour were not particularly effective in disentangling chemical perception and behavioural components of nestmate recognition by means of categorical variables. We therefore developed a novel bioassay that accurately isolates chemical perception from other cues. We studied four ant species: Camponotus herculeanus, C. vagus, Formica rufibarbis and F. cunicularia. Chemical analyses of cuticular extracts of workers of these four species showed that they varied in the number and identity of compounds and that species of the same genus have more similar profiles. The antennae of harnessed ants were touched with a glass rod coated with the cuticular extract of (a) nestmates, (b) non-nestmates of the same species, (c) another species of the same genus and (d) a species of a different genus. The mandible opening response (MOR) was recorded as the aggressive response. In all assayed species, MOR significantly differed among stimuli, being weakest towards nestmate odour and strongest towards odours originating from ants of a different genus. We thus introduce here a new procedure suitable for studying the chemical basis of aggression in ants.},

  abstract = {The Drosophila core circadian circuit contains distinct groups of interacting neurons that give rise to diurnal sleep-wake patterns. Previous work showed that a subset of dorsal neurons 1 (DN1s) are sleep-promoting through their inhibition of activity-promoting circadian pacemakers. Here we show that these anterior-projecting DNs (APDNs) also ``exit'' the circadian circuitry and communicate with the homeostatic sleep center in higher brain regions to regulate sleep and sleep-wake arousal. These APDNs connect to a small, discrete subset of tubercular-bulbar neurons, which are connected in turn to specific sleep-centric ellipsoid body (EB)-ring neurons of the central complex. Remarkably, activation of the APDNs produces sleep-like oscillations in the EB and affects arousal. The data indicate that this APDN-TuBusup-EB circuit temporally regulates sleep-wake arousal in addition to the previously defined role of the TuBu-EB circuit in vision, navigation, and attention. Guo et al. uncovered a novel neuronal circuit coupling the circadian neurons determining daily sleep pattern with neurons encoding sleep need and arousal. This circuit is involved in regulating sleep-wake arousal.},

However, because the octopus lacks any hard structure to which recording equipment can be anchored, and because it uses its eight flexible arms to remove any foreign object attached to the outside of its body, in~vivo recording of electrical activity from untethered, behaving octopuses has thus far not been possible. Here, we describe a novel technique for inserting a portable data logger into the octopus and implanting electrodes into the vertical lobe system, such that brain activity can be recorded for up to 12~h from unanesthetized, untethered octopuses and can be synchronized with simultaneous video recordings of behavior. In the brain activity, we identified several distinct patterns that appeared consistently in all animals. While some resemble activity patterns in mammalian neural tissue, others, such as episodes of 2~Hz, large amplitude oscillations, have not been reported. By providing an experimental platform for recording brain activity in behaving octopuses, our study is a critical step toward understanding how the brain controls behavior in these remarkable animals.},

Mice and rats are premier models of human disease and increasingly the model systems of choice for basic neuroscience. High frame rates (250 Hz) are needed to quantify the kinematics of these running rodents. Manual tracking, especially for multiple markers, becomes time-consuming and impossible for large sample sizes. Therefore, the need for automatic segmentation of these markers has grown in recent years. Here, we address this need by presenting a method to segment the markers using the simple linear iterative clustering superpixel method. The two-dimensional coordinates on the image plane are projected to a three-dimensional (3D) domain using direct linear transform and a 3D Kalman filter has been used to predict the position of markers based on the speed and position of markers from the previous frames. A probabilistic function is used to find the best match from among superpixels. The method is evaluated for different difficulties for tracking of the markers, and it achieves 95\% correct labeling of markers. Finally, the method was used to analyze data from an ongoing study seeking to improve recovery from spinal cord injury in rats.},

We tested predictions of this hypothesis in the superb fairy-wren, Malurus cyaneus, by investigating long-term individual differences in risk-related behaviors (latency to enter a novel artificial environment, exploration, activity and response to mirror image stimulation) and survival. We found consistent differences between individuals in these behaviors (adjusted repeatability of exploration of artificial novel environment = 0.37). Individual differences were consistent over several years and bi-variate analyses showed a significant among-individual correlation (``behavioral syndrome'') between exploration behavior at two life stages (young adult and old adult). Docility at the nestling stage predicted exploration behavior of juveniles. Behavioral traits measured in a risky context were correlated with one another, forming a behavioral syndrome of coping strategies ranging from ``proactive'' to ``reactive.'' Nestlings that were more active and exploratory in isolation were less docile during handling, while adults that entered the artificial environment fast were more exploratory, active, and aggressive in the artificial environment. Exploration behavior increased within individuals as they aged and when they were in poorer condition, consistent with expectations of more risk-prone behavior with lower residual reproductive value (RRV) (reduced ``asset protection''). Risk-related behavior predicted the probability of apparent survival: more exploratory individuals were less likely to be present in the population 12 months later. Our findings suggest that, consistent with the predictions of the POLS hypothesis, individual variation in survival is associated with consistent individual differences in risk-related behavior that are maintained long-term and span developmental boundaries.},

Many biologists are aware of p's frailties, but less clear about how they might change the way they analyse their data in response. This article highlights and summarizes four broad statistical approaches that augment or replace the p-value, and that are relatively straightforward to apply. First, you can augment your p-value with information about how confident you are in it, how likely it is that you will get a similar p-value in a replicate study, or the probability that a statistically significant finding is in fact a false positive. Second, you can enhance the information provided by frequentist statistics with a focus on effect sizes and a quantified confidence that those effect sizes are accurate. Third, you can augment or substitute p-values with the Bayes factor to inform on the relative levels of evidence for the null and alternative hypotheses; this approach is particularly appropriate for studies where you wish to keep collecting data until clear evidence for or against your hypothesis has accrued. Finally, specifically where you are using multiple variables to predict an outcome through model building, Akaike information criteria can take the place of the p-value, providing quantified information on what model is best. Hopefully, this quick-and-easy guide to some simple yet powerful statistical options will support biologists in adopting new approaches where they feel that the p-value alone is not doing their data justice.},

A 3-D biomechanical movement analysis of treadmill running was also conducted. RE was on average 47.8 and 62.3 ml O2 min-1 kg-1 at 14 and 18 km h-1. Maximal difference between the individual athletes was 21\% at 18 km h-1. Mechanical work rate was significantly correlated with VO2 measured in L min-1 at both running velocities. However, RE and relative work rate were not significantly correlated. LAch was significantly correlated with RE at 18 km h-1 implying that a short moment arm is advantageous regarding RE. Neither foot volume nor shank volume were significantly correlated to RE. Relative muscle fascicle length of m. soleus was significantly correlated with RE at 18 km h-1. Whole body stiffness and leg stiffness were significantly correlated with LAch indicating that a short moment arm coincided with high stiffness. It is concluded that a short LAch is correlated with RE. Probably, a short LAch allows for storage of a larger amount of elastic energy in the tendon and influences the force\textendash velocity relation toward a lower contraction velocity.},

  abstract = {Portia fimbriata from Queensland, Australia, is an araneophagic jumping spider (Salticidae) that includes in its predatory strategy a tactic (cryptic stalking) enabling it to prey effectively on a wide range of salticids from other genera. Optical cues used by P. fimbriata to identify the salticid species on which it most commonly preys, Jacksonoides queenslandicus, were investigated experimentally in the laboratory using odorless lures made from dead prey on which various combinations of features were altered. P. fimbriata adopted cryptic stalking only against intact salticid lures and modified lures on which the large anterior-median eyes were visible. Ordinary stalking was usually adopted when the lure did not have the anterior-median eyes visible. There was no evidence that cues from the legs of prey salticids influence the choice of stalking style of P. fimbriata, but cues from the legs do appear to influence strongly whether a prey is stalked at all. Cues from the cephalothorax and abdomen also influenced the stalking tendency, but to a lesser degree than cues from the legs. An algorithm to describe the perceptual processes of P. fimbriata when visually discriminating between salticid and non-salticid prey is discussed.},

  abstract = {Background: Even on short routes, ants can be guided by multiple visual memories. We investigate here the cues controlling memory retrieval as wood ants approach a one- or two-edged landmark to collect sucrose at a point along its base. In such tasks, ants store the desired retinal position of landmark edges at several points along their route. They guide subsequent trips by retrieving the appropriate memory and moving to bring the edges in the scene toward the stored positions. Results: The apparent width of the landmark turns out to be a powerful cue for retrieving the desired retinal position of a landmark edge. Two other potential cues, the landmark's apparent height and the distance that the ant walks, have little effect on memory retrieval. A simple model encapsulates these conclusions and reproduces the ants' routes in several conditions. According to this model, the ant stores a look-up table. Each entry contains the apparent width of the landmark and the desired retinal position of vertical edges. The currently perceived width provides an index for retrieving the associated stored edge positions. The model accounts for the population behavior of ants and the idiosyncratic training routes of individual ants. Discussion: Our results imply binding between the edge of a shape and its width and, further, imply that assessing the width of a shape does not depend on the presence of any particular local feature, such as a landmark edge. This property makes the ant's retrieval and guidance system relatively robust to edge occlusions. \textcopyright{} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The ability to achieve robust biological inference requires that practitioners know how and when to apply these tools. Here, we provide a general overview of current methods for the application of LMMs to biological data, and highlight the typical pitfalls that can be encountered in the statistical modelling process. We tackle several issues regarding methods of model selection, with particular reference to the use of information theory and multi-model inference in ecology. We offer practical solutions and direct the reader to key references that provide further technical detail for those seeking a deeper understanding. This overview should serve as a widely accessible code of best practice for applying LMMs to complex biological problems and model structures, and in doing so improve the robustness of conclusions drawn from studies investigating ecological and evolutionary questions.},

A total of 24 competitive sprinters (age: 23.1 [3.4] y, height: 1.81 [0.06] m, body mass: 75.7 [5.6] kg, and 100-m personal best: 10.86 [0.22] s) performed two 20-m starts from block and 2 to 3 flying sprints over 20 m. Kinematics were recorded in 3D using a motion tracking system with 21 cameras at a 250 Hz sampling rate. Several front- and back-side variables, including thigh (r = .64) and knee angle (r = .51) at lift-off and maximal thigh extension (r = .66), were largely correlated (P {$<$} .05) with accelerated running performance, and these variables displayed significantly higher correlations (P {$<$} .05) to accelerated running performance than nearly all the other analyzed variables. However, the relationship directions for most frontand back-side variables during accelerated running were opposite in comparison to how the theoretical concept has been described. Horizontal ankle velocity, contact time, and step rate displayed significantly higher correlation values to maximal velocity sprinting than the other variables (P {$<$} .05), and neither of the included front- and back-side variables were significantly associated with maximal velocity sprinting. Overall, the present findings did not support that front-side mechanics were crucial for sprint performance among the investigated sprinters.},

Many myths have been dispelled and many training practices have been altered as a result. In all of this, the techniques employed during the takeoff have received little attention. It is in this area that the most important developments are likely to take place in the next decade. In contrast with the long jump, satisfactory answers have yet to be obtained to even the most fundamental of questions about techniques in the triple jump. The triple jump is an experimental task with potential for use in studies of human locomotion, of visual perception and control, of the strength of biological materials and of the mechanisms of soft tissue injury. \textcopyright{} 1993.},

Trophobiosis between ants and aphids is a model system of such mutualistic interaction. To establish and maintain the mutualistic association, ants need to correctly discriminate mutualistic aphids. However, the mechanism by which ants recognize aphids as their partners is poorly understood, despite its ecological and evolutionary importance. Here, we show for the first time the evidence that interaction with nest-mates that have tended aphids (Aphis craccivora) allows ants (Tetramorium tsushimae) to learn to recognize the aphid species as their partner. When ants had previously tended aphids, they moderated their aggressiveness towards aphids. More importantly, ants that had interacted with aphid-experienced nest-mates also reduced their aggressiveness towards aphids, even though they had never directly experienced them, indicating that aphid information was transmitted from aphid-experienced ants to inexperienced ants. Furthermore, inhibition of mouth-to-mouth contact (trophallaxis) from aphid-experienced ants to inexperienced ants by providing the inexperienced ants with artificial honeydew solution caused the inexperienced ants to become aggressive towards aphids. These results, with further supporting data, strongly suggest that ants transfer information on their mutualists during trophallactic interactions.},

Methods: We conducted a mixed methods systematic review to summarise the research on doctoral researchers' (DRs) mental health. Our search revealed 52 articles that were included in this review. Results: The results of our meta-analysis found that DRs reported significantly higher stress levels compared with population norm data. Using meta-analyses and meta-synthesis techniques, we found the risk factors with the strongest evidence base were isolation and identifying as female. Social support, viewing the PhD as a process, a positive student-supervisor relationship and engaging in self-care were the most well-established protective factors. Conclusions: We have identified a critical need for researchers to better coordinate data collection to aid future reviews and allow for clinically meaningful conclusions to be drawn.

While many mechanisms leading to these constraints have been explored, their effects on the resolution at which temporal information is perceived have been largely overlooked. The visual system acts as a gateway to the dynamic environment and the relative resolution at which organisms are able to acquire and process visual information is likely to restrict their ability to interact with events around them. As both smaller size and higher metabolic rates should facilitate rapid behavioural responses, we hypothesized that these traits would favour perception of temporal change over finer timescales. Using critical flicker fusion frequency, the lowest frequency of flashing at which a flickering light source is perceived as constant, as a measure of the maximum rate of temporal information processing in the visual system, we carried out a phylogenetic comparative analysis of a wide range of vertebrates that supported this hypothesis. Our results have implications for the evolution of signalling systems and predator-prey interactions, and, combined with the strong influence that both body mass and metabolism have on a species' ecological niche, suggest that time perception may constitute an important and overlooked dimension of niche differentiation. \textcopyright{} 2013 The Authors.},

Using behavioral experiments this topic has been under intense investigation for nearly a century. In insects, this work has largely focused on the remarkable homing abilities of ants and bees. More recently, the neural basis of navigation shifted into the focus of attention. Starting with revealing the neurons that process the sensory signals used for navigation, in particular polarized skylight, migratory locusts became the key species for delineating navigation-relevant regions of the insect brain. Over the last years, this work was used as a basis for research in the fruit fly Drosophila and extraordinary progress has been made in illuminating the neural underpinnings of navigational processes. With increasingly detailed understanding of navigation circuits, we can begin to ask whether there is a fundamentally shared concept underlying all navigation behavior across insects. This review highlights recent advances and puts them into the context of the behavioral work on ants and bees, as well as the circuits involved in polarized-light processing. A region of the insect brain called the central complex emerges as the common substrate for guiding navigation and its highly organized neuroarchitecture provides a framework for future investigations potentially suited to explain all insect navigation behavior at the level of identified neurons.},

During sleep, animals are disconnected from the external world; they show high arousal thresholds and changed brain activity. Sleep deprivation results in a sleep rebound. Research using the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, has helped us understand the genetic and neuronal control of sleep. Genes involved in sleep control code for ion channels, factors influencing neurotransmission and neuromodulation, and proteins involved in the circadian clock. The neurotransmitters/neuromodulators involved in sleep control are GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine, serotonin, and several neuropeptides. Sleep is controlled by the interplay between sleep homeostasis and the circadian clock. Putative sleep-wake centers are located in higher-order brain centers that are indirectly connected to the circadian clock network. The primary function of sleep appears to be the downscaling of synapses that have been built up during wakefulness. Thus, brain homeostasis is maintained and learning and memory are assured.},

In all animals, the eyes are the main visual organs that are not only responsible for motion and colour (image) vision, but also transfer light information to the circadian clock in the brain. The way in which light entrains the circadian clock appears, however, variable in different species. As do vertebrates, insects possess extraretinal photoreceptors in addition to their eyes (and ocelli) that are sometimes located close to (underneath) the eyes, but sometimes even in the central brain. These extraretinal photoreceptors contribute to entrainment of their circadian clocks to different degrees. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is special, because it expresses the blue light-sensitive cryptochrome (CRY) directly in its circadian clock neurons, and CRY is usually regarded as the fly's main circadian photoreceptor. Nevertheless, recent studies show that the retinal and extraretinal eyes transfer light information to almost every clock neuron and that the eyes are similarly important for entraining the fly's activity rhythm as in other insects, or more generally spoken in other animals. Here, I compare the light input pathways between selected insect species with a focus on Drosophila's special case.},

The view that torpor is an evolutionary extension of sleep is supported by electrophysiological studies. However, comparisons of factors that influence the expression of sleep and torpor uncover significant differences. Deep sleep immediately following torpor suggests that torpor is functionally a period of sleep deprivation. Recent studies that employ post-torpor sleep deprivation, however, show that the post-torpor intense sleep is not homeostatically regulated, but might be a reflection of synaptic loss and replacement. The circadian system regulates sleep expression in euthermic mammals in such a way that would appear to preclude multiday bouts of torpor. Indeed, the circadian system is robust in animals that show shallow torpor, but its activity in hibernators is at least damped if not absent. There is good evidence from some species, however, that the circadian system plays important roles in the timing of bouts of torpor.},

Rest is affected by both homeostatic and circadian influences: when rest is prevented, the flies increasingly tend to rest despite stimulation and then exhibit a rest rebound. Drugs acting on a mammalian adenosine receptor alter rest as they do sleep, suggesting conserved neural mecha- nisms.

Here, we propose a new framework to study behavioral evolution by computational estimation of ancestral behavioral repertoires. We measured the behaviors of individuals from six species of fruit flies using unsupervised techniques and identified suites of stereotyped movements exhibited by each species. We then fit a Generalized Linear Mixed Model to estimate the suites of behaviors exhibited by ancestral species, as well as the intra- and inter-species behavioral covariances. We found that much of intraspecific behavioral variation is explained by differences between individuals in the status of their behavioral hidden states, what might be called their ``mood.'' Lastly, we propose a method to identify groups of behaviors that appear to have evolved together, illustrating how sets of behaviors, rather than individual behaviors, likely evolved. Our approach provides a new framework for identifying co-evolving behaviors and may provide new opportunities to study the genetic basis of behavioral evolution.}

Proper maintenance of body orientation was defined to be achieved if the net angular displacement of the head-and-trunk segment was zero during the flight phase of the long jump. To achieve a zero net angular displacement of the head-and-trunk segment a long jumper needs to execute appropriate arm and leg movements relative to the head-and-trunk segment to counteract the effects of the whole body transverse centroidal angular momentum imparted at takeoff. The contributions of arm and leg movements to the maintenance of body orientation are discussed for the specific cases of a sail and a 2 1/2 hitch-kick long jump. Inherent weaknesses of the sail and hitch-kick techniques, as well as specific weaknesses of two athletes executing these techniques, are discussed with reference to body orientation during the flight phase of the long jump. \textcopyright{} 1986 by the American college of Sports Medicine.},

  abstract = {When a larva of the red flour beetle Tribolium freemani (Hinton) was introduced into a vial, the larva pupated within 6 days, whereas when two larvae were introduced, the larvae pupated in 12 days. Crowded larvae delayed production of juvenile-hormone esterase (JHE) and release of ecdysteroids, as measured by radioimmunoassay, compared with the isolated larvae. The highest JHE activity was observed at pupal ecdysis in both groups and there were increases in whole-body ecdysteroid levels during the last part of intermoult before pupation and adult emergence, which coincided with decreases in ecdysteroid titres in both isolated and crowded groups. Cold shock, heat stress, the JHE inhibitor methamidophos, and juvenile hormone (JH) I delayed pupation in isolated larvae. Cold shock, heat stress and methamidophos reduced the JHE activity, and cold shock and JH I reduced ecdysteroid levels in isolated larvae. Light, vibration and a nonsteroidal ecdysteroid agonist RH 5849 stimulated pupation in crowded T. freemani larvae, which was antagonized by JH I. The JHE activity and ecdysteroid levels were higher in crowded larvae reared under 24 h light or treated with vibration, octopamine agonists and precocene II than those control larvae kept in constant darkness.},

For rodents, however, all previous attempts to develop VR systems in which rats behave in the same way as in corresponding 3-D environments have failed. The question arises as to whether, in principle, rodents can be trained to navigate in a properly designed virtual environment (VE), or whether this peculiarity is limited to primates and humans. We built a virtual reality set-up that takes the wide-angle visual system of rats into account. We show for the first time that rats learn spatial tasks in this VE quite readily. This set-up opens up new opportunities for investigations of information processing in navigation (e.g. the importance of optic flow or vestibular input).},

A simple mathematical model fits satisfactorily the data available on the distribution of foragers over the trophoporic field of the colony, and prediction of the effects of changes in density of the prey populations has been attempted. The effects of temperature, and also of obstruction to free movement, on the rate at which food is gathered are considered. Distinction is made between the dispersal of nomadic animals and of resident ones which, like ants, return periodically to a home base; some implications of the type of distribution pattern found, as they bear on the determination of the optimum size of a certain type of wildlife reserve, are briefly discussed.

Long-term studies of insect diversity trends are still rare, even though such studies are highly important to assess extent, drivers and potential consequences of insect loss in ecosystems. To gain insights into carabid diversity trends of ancient and sustainably managed woodlands, we analysed data of carabid beetles from a trapping study that has been run for 24 years in an old nature reserve of Northern Germany, the L\"uneburg Heath. We examined temporal changes in several diversity measures (e.g. biomass, species richness, functional diversity and phylogenetic diversity) and tested diverse species traits as predictor variables for species occurrence. In contrast to recently published long-term studies of insect diversity, we did not observe a decline in biomass, but in species richness and phylogenetic diversity in carabids at our study site. Additionally, hibernation stage predicted the occurrence probability of carabids: Species hibernating as imagines or both imagines and larvae and breeding in spring showed strongest declines. We assume the detected trends to be the result of external effects such as climate change and the application of pesticides in the surrounding. Our results suggest that the drivers for the insect decline and the responses are multifaceted. This highlights the importance of long-term studies with identification of the catches to, at best, species level to support the understanding of mechanisms driving changes in insect diversity and abundance.},

  abstract = {Oriented behaviour is present in almost all animals, indicating that it is an ancient feature that has emerged from animal brains hundreds of millions of years ago. Although many complex navigation strategies have been described, each strategy can be broken down into a series of elementary navigational decisions. In each moment in time, an animal has to compare its current heading with its desired direction and compensate for any mismatch by producing a steering response either to the right or to the left. Different from reflex-driven movements, target-directed navigation is not only initiated in response to sensory input, but also takes into account previous experience and motivational state. Once a series of elementary decisions are chained together to form one of many coherent navigation strategies, the animal can pursue a navigational target, e.g. a food source, a nest entrance or a constant flight direction during migrations. Insects show a great variety of complex navigation behaviours and, owing to their small brains, the pursuit of the neural circuits controlling navigation has made substantial progress over the last years. A brain region as ancient as insects themselves, called the central complex, has emerged as the likely navigation centre of the brain. Research across many species has shown that the central complex contains the circuitry that might comprise the neural substrate of elementary navigational decisions. Although this region is also involved in a wide range of other functions, we hypothesize in this Review that its role in mediating the animal's next move during target-directed behaviour is its ancestral function, around which other functions have been layered over the course of evolution.},

Desiccation resistance increased with body size (as dry weight0.55), but not as quickly as expected from the consequences of the surface area and volume relationship (as dry weight0.67). Arboreal ants took 8 times longer to die than terrestrial ants of comparable size. Even after size effects were removed, desiccation resistance differed between various terrestrial species and showed a correlation with foraging patterns. Arboreal and terrestrial ants whose waterproofing epicuticular lipids were removed by chloroform: methanol extraction had equally high water loss rates at 0\% r.h. Unextracted arboreal ants had water loss rates half those of unextracted terrestrial ants, suggesting that differences between them were based on differences in epicuticular lipids. The lower water loss rates of arboreal ants contributed significantly to their longer survival under desiccation. Arboreal ants also had greater total rectal pad area than terrestrial ants, suggesting that they may be able to reclaim faecal water more effectively. There were no differences in the minimum viable water content between the two groups of ants. Both had water loss tolerances comparable with those of arthropods adapted to xeric environments. Initial water loss rates could not account for all of the differences in desiccation resistance between arboreal and terrestrial ants. Other adaptations to desiccation stress by arboreal ants are likely. Comparisons of water loss rates and desiccation resistance between arboreal and desert ants suggest that the arboreal habitat is at least as stressful as the desert habitat.

The model character of crickets was justified by their external gravity receptors, identified position-sensitive interneurons (PSI) and gravity-related compensatory head response, and by the specific relation of this behavior to neuronal activation systems. These advantages allowed us to study the impact of modified gravity on cellular processes in a complex organism. Eggs, 1st, 4th and 6th stage larvae of Acheta domesticus were used. Post-flight experiments revealed a low susceptibility of the behavior to microgravity ({$\mu$}g) and hypergravity (hg) while the physiology of the PSI was significantly affected. Immunocytological investigations revealed a stage-dependent sensitivity of thoracic GABAergic motoneurons to 3g-conditions concerning their soma sizes but not their topographical arrangement. Peptidergic neurons from cerebral sensorimotor centers revealed no significant modifications by microgravity. The contrary physiological and behavioral results indicate a facilitation of 1g-readaptation by accessory gravity, proprioceptive and visual sense organs. Absence of anatomical modifications point to an effective time window of {$\mu$}g- or hg-exposure related to the period of neuronal proliferation.},

This involved determining local motion sensitivity and its directional selectivity at many points within the neurone's receptive field and plotting the results on a map. Our results showed that local preferred directions of motion are independent of velocity, stimulus shape and type of motion (circular or linear). Global response maps thus clearly represent real properties of the neurones' receptive fields. Using this method, we have discovered two families of interneurones sensitive to translational optic flow. The first family has its terminal arborisations in the lobula of the optic lobe, the second family in the medulla. The response maps of the lobula neurones (which appear to be monostratified lobular giant neurones) show a clear focus of expansion centred on or just above the horizon, but at significantly different azimuth angles. Response maps such as these, consisting of patterns of movement vectors radiating from a pole, would be expected of neurones responding to self-motion in a particular direction. They would be stimulated when the crab moves towards the pole of the neurone's receptive field. The response maps of the medulla neurones show a focus of contraction, approximately centred on the horizon, but at significantly different azimuth angles. Such neurones would be stimulated when the crab walked away from the pole of the neurone's receptive field. We hypothesise that both the lobula and the medulla interneurones are representatives of arrays of cells, each of which would be optimally activated by self-motion in a different direction. The lobula neurones would be stimulated by the approaching scene and the medulla neurones by the receding scene. Neurones tuned to translational optic flow provide information on the three-dimensional layout of the environment and are thought to play a role in the judgment of heading.},

It has become commonplace to extract predictions of individual random effects from such models for use in subsequent analyses (for example, between a personality trait and other individual traits such as cognition, physiology, or fitness-related measures). However, these predictions are made with large amounts of error that is not carried forward, rendering further tests susceptible to spurious P values from these individual-level point estimates. We briefly summarize the problems with such statistical methods that are used regularly by behavioural ecologists, and highlight the robust solutions that exist within the mixed model framework, providing tutorials to aid in their implementation.},

Expression of tachykinin in a cluster of neurons was recently shown to determine the stimulus response threshold for aggressive behavior in Drosophila (1). Varying response thresholds are often implicated in division of labor within social insect colonies, so we hypothesized that Tachykinin could play a role in the organization of colony defense by affecting individual response thresholds to non-nestmate stimuli. We used quantitative-PCR in combination with behavioral assays to test for associations between the expression of Tachykinin and its receptor, and the aggressive division of labor among the castes of the leaf-cutting ant Acromyrmex echinatior, a species with multiple worker castes. After correction for differences in brain size among castes, we found that the most aggressive large worker caste had the highest Tachykinin expression levels, but that no such effect was apparent for breeding and virgin queens. To further evaluate these deviating results for the reproductive caste, we manipulated the aggression threshold of virgin-queens by removing their wings, which is known to make them express a soldier-like behavioral phenotype. Despite heightened aggression, expression levels of Tachykinin remained unaffected, suggesting that aggression levels in reproductive caste phenotypes are controlled by differential expression of other genes.},

Like honeybees, the bees accurately estimated the distance to the previously offered food source as seen from the sections of the tunnel where they turned around in search of the food. Changing the visual flow by decreasing the width of the flight tunnel resulted in the underestimation of the distance flown. The removal of image motion cues either in the ventral or lateral field of view reduced the bees' ability to gauge distances. When the feeder inside the tunnel was displaced together with the bees feeding on it while preventing the bee from seeing any image motion during the displacement the bees experienced different distances on their way to the food source and during their return to the nest. In the subsequent test the bees searched for the food predominantly at the distance associated with their return flight.},

Here we use laser microsurgery to create a chronic fly preparation for repeated imaging of neural architecture and dynamics for up to 50 days. In fly mushroom body neurons, we track axonal boutons for 10 days and record odor-evoked calcium transients over 7 weeks. Further, by using voltage imaging to resolve individual action potentials, we monitor spiking plasticity in dopamine neurons of flies undergoing mechanical stress. After 24 h of stress, PPL1-{$\alpha$}'3 but not PPL1-{$\alpha$}'2{$\alpha$}2 dopamine neurons have elevated spike rates. Overall, our chronic preparation is compatible with a broad range of optical techniques and enables longitudinal studies of many biological questions that could not be addressed before in live flies.},

Background: There is growing concern about the mental health of university students in general and healthcare students in particular. Shifts in Higher Education policy, encouraging a ``whole university approach,'' may place greater responsibility for student mental health on academics. However, little is known about the challenges that poor student mental health creates for academics on healthcare programmes. Design: A qualitative approach, using semi-structured interviews and focus groups, provided the opportunity for in-depth analysis. Methods: Fourteen academics on healthcare programmes, including seven lecturers from nursing programmes, were interviewed between May\textendash June 2017. Constant comparison analysis was followed to support grounded theory. Results: Four key themes emerged. Academics had difficulty identifying and maintaining boundaries due to competing academic and professional identities. Student disclosures are accompanied by challenges arising due to professional responsibilities. Supporting student mental health on placement is difficult. Academics are aware and concerned about the potential negative impact of course content and practice on student mental health. Conclusion: This is the first study to explore in-depth the challenges faced by academics on healthcare programmes by the rising prevalence of and concern for, student mental health. The findings indicate that leaders of nursing education programmes and their managers, need to be aware that academics face complex challenges in managing and responding student mental health and may struggle to maintain boundaries due, in part, to competing professional identities.},

For example when laying eggs, female Drosophila avoid geosmin, an odorant produced by toxic moulds. Here we identify second, third, and fourth order neurons required for this innate olfactory aversion. Connectomics data place these neurons in a complete synaptic circuit from sensory input to descending output. We find multiple levels of valence-specific convergence, including a novel form of axo-axonic input onto second order neurons conveying another danger signal, the pheromone of parasitoid wasps. However, we also observe extensive divergence: second order geosmin neurons connect with a diverse array of 80 third order cell types. We find a pattern of convergence of aversive odour channels at this level. Crossing one more synaptic layer, we identified descending neurons critical for egg-laying aversion. Our data suggest a transition from a labelled line organisation in the periphery to a highly distributed central brain representation that is then coupled to distinct descending pathways.},

  abstract = {Sleep-like behavior has been studied in honeybees before, but the relationship between sleep and memory formation has not been explored. Here we describe a new approach to address the question if sleep in bees, like in other animals, improves memory consolidation. Restrained bees were observed by a web camera, and their antennal activities were used as indicators of sleep. We found that the bees sleep more during the dark phase of the day compared with the light phase. Sleep phases were characterized by two distinct patterns of antennal activities: symmetrical activity, more prominent during the dark phase; and asymmetrical activity, more common during the light phase. Sleep-deprived bees showed rebound the following day, confirming effective deprivation of sleep. After appetitive conditioning of the bees to various olfactory stimuli, we observed their sleep. Bees conditioned to odor with sugar reward showed lesser sleep compared with bees that were exposed to either reward alone or air alone. Next, we asked whether sleep deprivation affects memory consolidation. While sleep deprivation had no effect on retention scores after odor acquisition, retention for extinction learning was significantly reduced, indicating that consolidation of extinction memory but not acquisition memory was affected by sleep deprivation. \textcopyright{} 2009 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

  abstract = {Sleep is a state of immobility characterized by three key criteria: an increased threshold of arousal, rapid reversal to an alert state and evidence of homeostatic `rebound sleep' in which there is an increase in the time spent in this quiescent state following sleep deprivation. Common European cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis, show states of quiescence during which they meet the last two of these three criteria, yet also show spontaneous bursts of arm and eye movements that accompany rapid changes in chromatophore patterns in the skin. Here, we report that this rapid eye movement sleep-like (REMS-like) state is cyclic in nature. Iterations of the REMS-like state last 2.42{$\pm$}0.22\hspace{0.25em}min (mean{$\pm$}s.e.m.) and alternate with 34.01{$\pm$}1.49\hspace{0.25em}min of the quiescent sleep-like state for durations lasting 176.89{$\pm$}36.71\hspace{0.25em}min. We found clear evidence that this REMS-like state (i) occurs in animals younger than previously reported; (ii) follows an ultradian pattern; (iii) includes intermittent dynamic chromatophore patterning, representing fragments of normal patterning seen in the waking state for a wide range of signaling and camouflage; and (iv) shows variability in the intensity of expression of these skin patterns between and within individuals. These data suggest that cephalopods, which are mollusks with an elaborate brain and complex behavior, possess a sleep-like state that resembles behaviorally the vertebrate REM sleep state, although the exact nature and mechanism of this form of sleep may differ from that of vertebrates.},

Behavioral changes during flight in the Y-maze are measured by counting the number of bees which crossed a decision line. However, in order to reveal the neuronal mechanisms that control flight, it is necessary to analyze the dynamical properties of flight trajectories, because visual information is changed by the honeybee's position, direction and velocity.

In some model systems genetically-targeted expression of fluorescent proteins is the method of choice; however, these genetic tools are not available for most organisms and alternative labeling methods are very limited. Here we describe a new method for neuronal labelling by electrophoretic dye delivery from a suction electrode directly through the neuronal sheath of nerves and ganglia in insects. Polar tracer molecules were delivered into the locust auditory nerve without destroying its function, simultaneously staining peripheral sensory structures and central axonal projections. Local neuron populations could be labelled directly through the surface of the brain, and in-vivo optical imaging of sound-evoked activity was achieved through the electrophoretic delivery of calcium indicators. The method provides a new tool for studying how stimuli are processed in peripheral and central sensory pathways and is a significant advance for the study of nervous systems in non-model organisms.}

The medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) has been suggested to play a pivotal role in this process. Grid cells, head-direction cells, border cells as well as speed cells within the MEC collectively provide a dynamic representation of the animal position in space based on the integration of self-movements. All these cells are strongly modulated by theta oscillations, thus suggesting that theta rhythmicity in the MEC may be essential for integrating and coordinating self-movement information during navigation. In this study, we first show that excitotoxic MEC lesions, but not dorsal hippocampal lesions, impair the ability of rats to estimate linear distances based on self-movement information. Next, we report similar deficits following medial septum inactivation, which strongly impairs theta oscillations in the entorhinal\textendash hippocampal circuits. Taken together, these findings demonstrate a major role of the MEC and MS in estimating distances to be traveled, and point to theta oscillations within the MEC as a neural mechanism responsible for the integration of information generated by linear self-displacements.},

Time-continuous kinematic data of 57 trials (4.45-6.84 m) was analyzedCluster analysis identified at coarse level different movement patterns for each flight and support phase, Above these structural differences, individual movement patterns were diagnosed, especially for the jump. Further, the contribution of single variables on the differences of the complex movement patterns was determined by discriminant analysis. Based on the result, conclusions were drawn concerning the long jump and individuality in training. Overall, the applied pattern recognition method allows for the identification of structural changes of movement patterns as well as individual movement styles.

Most learning walks of 12 individually marked na\"ive ants took place in the morning with a narrow time window separating the first two learning walks, which most often occurred on the same day. Na\"ive ants performed between two and seven walks over up to four consecutive days before heading out to forage. On subsequent walks, na\"ive ants tend to explore the area around the nest in new compass directions. During learning walks, ants move along arcs around the nest while performing oscillating scanning movements. In a regular temporal sequence, the ants' gaze oscillates between the nest direction and the direction pointing away from the nest. Ants thus experience a sequence of views roughly across the nest and away from the nest from systematically spaced vantage points around the nest. Further, we show that ants leaving the nest for a foraging trip often walk in an arc around the nest on the opposite side to the intended foraging direction, performing a scanning routine indistinguishable from that of a learning walk. These partial learning walks are triggered by disturbance around the nest and may help returning ants with reorienting when overshooting the nest, which they frequently do. We discuss what is known about learning walks in different ant species and their adaptive significance for acquiring robust navigational memories.},

It did not come as a surprise, as I had expected that toward the end of the Human Brain Project (HBP)'s 10-year funding period, there will be a rush of articles and generally increased media interest in covering the project's progress, achievements, and failures, although In Silico is special, given its 10-year time frame. I joined the HBP in 2014 and lead today one of three science work packages. For this documentary, I expected to hear requests for interviews, but there was literally nothing of that sort. After I have finally watched In Silico , I understand why. The documentary is in fact not about HBP, despite claims to the contrary by a previous review (Abbott, 2020). In Silico director, Noah Hutton, rather focuses on his fascination with Henry Markram's 10-year vision of building a brain from the bottom up, the Blue Brain Project (BBP). As will be described towards the end, the HBP follows a stringent and much broader concept of integrating neuroscience and medicine with technology. In a companion commentary (Destexhe, 2021), Alain Destexhe explains that only a small percentage of the actual efforts in HBP is devoted to Henry Markram's activities in the project, I will thus not further dwell on it. My second expectation was to find a discussion of science, shedding light on the scientific controversy regarding the endeavor of constructing an in silico brain. Disappointingly, this expectation was not fulfilled either, and it is, in my opinion, a missed opportunity. Noah Hutton thematizes several points such as bottom-up construction, consciousness, as well as noise and variability. But the discussion remains shallow, hardly reaching beyond snippets of statements by neuroscientists flagging key words and reiterating the \ldots},

Sleep could result from global changes in the brain during wakefulness or it could be regulated by specific loci that recruit the rest of the brain into the electrical and metabolic states characteristic of sleep. Here we address this issue by exploiting the genetic tractability of the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster, which exhibits the hallmarks of vertebrate sleep. We show that large changes in sleep are achieved by spatial and temporal enhancement of cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activity specifically in the adult mushroom bodies of Drosophila. Other manipulations of the mushroom bodies, such as electrical silencing, increasing excitation or ablation, also alter sleep. These results link sleep regulation to an anatomical locus known to be involved in learning and memory. \textcopyright{} 2006 Nature Publishing Group.},

  abstract = {Social grouping is omnipresent in the animal kingdom. Considerable research has focused on understanding how animal groups form and function, including how collective behaviour emerges via self-organising mechanisms and how phenotypic variation drives the behaviour and functioning of animal groups. However, we still lack a mechanistic understanding of the role of phenotypic variation in collective animal behaviour. Here we present a common framework to quantify individual heterogeneity and synthesise the literature to systematically explain and predict its role in collective behaviour across species, contexts, and traits. We show that individual heterogeneity provides a key intermediary mechanism with broad consequences for sociality (e.g., group structure, functioning), ecology (e.g., response to environmental change), and evolution. We also outline a roadmap for future research.},

These phenomena strongly resemble four characteristic features of sleep in humans, mammals and birds. It is thus very likely that the profound rest which forager bees experience at night is sleep. This assumption is further supported by the results of previous investigations of visual interneurones in the bee.2.The antennae of sleeping bees manifest characteristic postural constellations (Fig. 6). High reaction thresholds are associated with particular antennal positions.3.The total sleep time (duration of antennal immobility plus duration of small antennal movements) in 24 h for two bees was 7.6 h and 4.9 h (Table 1).4.Bees which rest in a hive at night also display phenomena which have been encountered during the laboratory investigations.5.Sleep in mammals is an active, controlled process; the same seems to be true of sleep in honeybees (Figs. 3, 4).

Here, we report a sleep-like state in the cnidarian Hydra vulgaris with a primitive nervous organization. Hydra sleep was shaped by homeostasis and necessary for cell proliferation, but it lacked free-running circadian rhythms. Instead, we detected 4-hour rhythms that might be generated by ultradian oscillators underlying Hydra sleep. Microarray analysis in sleep-deprived Hydra revealed sleep-dependent expression of 212 genes, including cGMP-dependent protein kinase 1 (PRKG1) and ornithine aminotransferase. Sleep-promoting effects of melatonin, GABA, and PRKG1 were conserved in Hydra. However, arousing dopamine unexpectedly induced Hydra sleep. Opposing effects of ornithine metabolism on sleep were also evident between Hydra and Drosophila, suggesting the evolutionary switch of their sleep-regulatory functions. Thus, sleep-relevant physiology and sleep-regulatory components may have already been acquired at molecular levels in a brain-less metazoan phylum and reprogrammed accordingly. The brain-less freshwater polyp Hydra controls sleep-wake cycles by mechanisms conserved or reprogrammed among animal species.

Whereas mammals use internal energy to regulate body temperature, ectotherms typically regulate body temperature behaviorally [1]. Some ectotherms maintain homeostasis via a daily temperature preference rhythm (TPR) [2], but the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we show that Drosophila exhibit a daily circadian clock-dependent TPR that resembles mammalian BTR. Pacemaker neurons critical for locomotor activity are not necessary for TPR; instead, the dorsal neuron 2~s (DN2s), whose function was previously unknown, is sufficient. This indicates that TPR, like BTR, is controlled independently from locomotor activity. Therefore, the mechanisms controlling temperature fluctuations in fly TPR and~mammalian BTR may share parallel features. Taken together, our results reveal the existence of a novel DN2-based circadian neural circuit that specifically regulates TPR; thus, understanding the mechanisms of TPR will shed new light on the function and neural control of circadian rhythms.},

The effect of these cues on behavior is well-characterized in Drosophila, however, little is known about synchronization in non-model insect species. Therefore, we explored entrainment of locomotor activity by light and temperature in the linden bug Pyrrhocoris apterus (Heteroptera), an insect species with a strong seasonal response (reproductive diapause), which is triggered by both photoperiod and thermoperiod. Our results show that either light or temperature cycles are strong factors entraining P. apterus locomotor activity. Pyrrhocoris is able to be partially synchronized by cycles with temperature amplitude as small as 3\textdegree C and more than 50\% of bugs is synchronized by 5\textdegree C steps. If conflicting zeitgebers are provided, light is the stronger signal. Linden bugs lack light-sensitive (Drosophila-like) cryptochrome. Notably, a high percentage of bugs is rhythmic even in constant light (LL) at intensity {$\sim$}400 lux, a condition which induces 100\% arrhythmicity in Drosophila. However, the rhythmicity of bugs is still reduced in LL conditions, whereas rhythmicity remains unaffected in constant dark (DD). Interestingly, a similar phenomenon is observed after temperature cycles entrainment. Bugs released to constant thermophase and DD display weak rhythmicity, whereas strong rhythmicity is observed in bugs released to constant cryophase and DD. Our study describes the daily and circadian behavior of the linden bug as a response to photoperiodic and thermoperiodic entraining cues. Although the molecular mechanism of the circadian clock entrainment in the linden bug is virtually unknown, our study contributes to the knowledge of the insect circadian clock features beyond Drosophila research.},

Temperature cycle is an important time cue for entrainment, even in mammals, since the daily change in body temperature is thought to be used for phase regulation of clocks in peripheral tissues. However, little is known about the mechanisms by which temperature resets the clock. In the present study, we investigated the effect of temperature on circadian activity rhythm and clock gene transcription by using the cricket, Gryllus bimaculatus. We show that temperature cycle can entrain both behavioral and transcriptional rhythms of clock genes, such as period, timeless, cryptochrome2 and cycle in the circadian pacemaker tissue, optic lobe. Under temperature cycle, phase of evening peak of locomotor activity occurred 1 h before the warm-to-cold phase transition, which is associated with earlier peaks of mRNA expression rhythm of the clock genes than that under light/dark cycles. When the temperature cycle was advanced by 6 h, behavioral rhythms re-entrained to newly phased temperature cycle after {$\sim$}16 transient cycles. The mRNA oscillation of period and timeless gained stable rhythm under phase advanced temperature cycles with a lesser number of transient cycles than cryptochrome2 and cycle. These results suggest that temperature cycle can entrain behavioral and molecular rhythms in cricket and clock genes vary in sensitivity to temperature. It is thus likely that clock genes play differential roles in resetting the clock with environmental temperature changes.},

Repeatability in how metabolic rate changes across temperatures (i.e. metabolic thermal plasticity) can influence mass-scaling exponents in different thermal environments. Moreover, repeatable plastic responses are necessary for reaction norms to respond to selective forces which is important for populations living in fluctuating environments. Nonetheless, only a small number of studies have explicitly quantified repeatability in metabolic plasticity, and fewer have explored how it can impact mass-scaling. We repeatedly measured standard metabolic rate of n = 42 delicate skinks Lampropholis delicata at six temperatures over the course of four months (N[observations] = 4952). Using hierarchical statistical techniques, we accounted for multi-level variation and measurement error in our data in order to obtain more precise estimates of reaction norm repeatability and mass-scaling exponents at different acute temperatures. Our results show that individual differences in metabolic thermal plasticity were somewhat consistent over time (Rslope = 0.25, 95\% CI = 2.48 \texttimes{} 10-8 \textendash{} 0.67), however estimates were associated with a large degree of error. After accounting for measurement error, which decreased steadily with temperature, we show that among individual variance remained consistent across all temperatures. Congruently, temperature specific repeatability of average metabolic rate was stable across temperatures. Cross-temperature correlations were positive but were not uniform across the reaction norm. After taking into account multiple sources of variation, our estimates for mass-scaling did not change with temperature and were in line with published values for snakes and lizards. This implies that repeatable plastic responses may promote thermal stability of scaling exponents. Our work contributes to understanding how energy expenditure scales with abiotic and biotic factors and the capacity for reaction norms to respond to selection.},

Repeatability of average metabolic rate was, on average, 10\% lower in hot incubated lizards but stable across all temperatures. The slope of the thermal reaction norm was overall moderately repeatable (R\,=\,0.44, 95\% CI\,=\,0.035 \textendash{} 0.93) suggesting that individual metabolic rate changed consistently with short-term changes in temperature, although credible intervals were quite broad. Importantly, reaction norm repeatability did not depend on early developmental temperature. Identifying factors affecting among-individual variation in thermal plasticity will be increasingly more important for terrestrial ectotherms living in changing climate. Our work implies that thermal metabolic plasticity is robust to early developmental temperatures and has the capacity to evolve, despite there being less consistent variation in metabolic rate under hot environments.},

It consists of four components: (1) a 3D calibration module, (2) filters to resolve 2D tracking errors, (3) a triangulation module that integrates temporal and spatial regularization, and (4) a pipeline to structure processing of large numbers of videos. We evaluate Anipose on four datasets: a moving calibration board, fruit flies walking on a treadmill, mice reaching for a pellet, and humans performing various actions. By analyzing 3D leg kinematics tracked with Anipose, we identify a key role for joint rotation in motor control of fly walking.

However, how motion cues guide behavior is poorly understood, as the neural circuits that implement these computations are largely unknown in any organism. We develop a systematic, forward genetic approach using high-throughput, quantitative behavioral analyses to identify the neural substrates of motion vision in Drosophila in an unbiased fashion. We then delimit the behavioral contributions of both known and novel circuit elements. Contrary to expectation from previous studies, we find that orienting responses to motion are shaped by at least two neural pathways. These pathways are sensitive to different visual features, diverge immediately postsynaptic to photoreceptors, and are coupled to distinct behavioral outputs. Thus, behavioral responses to complex stimuli can rely on surprising neural specialization from even the earliest sensory processing stages. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) environments are a powerful tool to investigate brain mechanisms involved in the behavior of animals. With this technique, animals are usually head fixed or secured in a harness, and training for cognitively more complex VR paradigms is time consuming. A VR apparatus allowing free animal movement and the constant operator-independent training of tasks would enable many new applications. Key prospective usages include brain imaging of animal behavior when carrying a miniaturized mobile device such as a fluorescence microscope or an optetrode. Here, we introduce the Servoball, a spherical VR treadmill based on the closed-loop tracking of a freely moving animal and feedback counterrotation of the ball. Furthermore, we present the complete integration of this experimental system with the animals' group home cage, from which single individuals can voluntarily enter through a tunnel with radio-frequency identification (RFID)-automated access control and commence experiments. This automated animal sorter functions as a mechanical replacement of the experimenter. We automatically trained rats using visual or acoustic cues to solve spatial cognitive tasks and recorded spatially modulated entorhinal cells. When electrophysiological extracellular recordings from awake behaving rats were performed, head fixation can dramatically alter results, so that any complex behavior that requires head movement is impossible to achieve. We circumvented this problem with the use of the Servoball in open-field scenarios, as it allows the combination of open-field behavior with the recording of nerve cells, along with all the flexibility that a virtual environment brings. This integrated home cage with a VR arena experimental system permits highly efficient experimentation for complex cognitive experiments.},

Path integration has been investigated in depth in insects and humans. Demonstrations in rodents, however, mostly stem from experiments on heading direction; less is known about distance estimation. We introduce a novel behavioural paradigm that allows for probing temporal and spatial contributions to path integration. The paradigm is a bisection task comprising movement in a virtual reality environment in combination with either timing the duration ran or estimating the distance covered. We performed experiments with Mongolian gerbils and could show that the animals can keep track of time and distance during spatial navigation.},

  abstract = {A major activity of the brain of most vertebrates during waking behavior is the processing of sensory information, preponderantly visual. This processing is not fully compatible with the brain's spontaneous oscillatory activity that maintains (refreshes) infrequently used circuits that store inherited and experiential information (memories). Great reduction in sensory input and processing during sleep permits the refreshment of memory circuits to occur unimpededly. Accordingly, sleep may have evolved as ever augmenting needs for processing visual information during waking behavior by brains of great complexity conflicted increasingly with needs to refresh memory circuits. The lack of a need for sleep by genetically blind fishes that live in caves, and sighted fishes that swim continuously, is consistent with this thesis, as their needs for processing of sensory information, predominantly visual, are either greatly reduced or nil. Reduced requirements for processing sensory information by continuously swimming fishes owe to the following aspects of their behavior and ecology: (1) visual input is greatly reduced or absent during lengthy periods of nocturnal activity; (2) schooling greatly reduces needs for sensory information, particularly visual; (3) being maintained through frequent use, circuitry for most inherited memories needs no refreshment; and (4) inasmuch as they lead a comparatively routine existence in essentially featureless, open waters, pelagic species acquire, and have need to refresh, relatively few experiential memories. Analogous circumstances could account for the ability of migrating birds to fly for days without rest or sleep.},

  abstract = {The circadian clock of social insects has become a focal point of interest for research, as social insects show complex forms of timed behavior and organization within their colonies. These behaviors include brood care, nest maintenance, foraging, swarming, defense, and many other tasks, of which several require social synchronization and accurate timing. Ants of the genus Camponotus have been shown to display a variety of daily timed behaviors such as the emergence of males from the nest, foraging, and relocation of brood. Nevertheless, circadian rhythms of isolated individuals have been studied in few ant species, and the circadian clock network in the brain that governs such behaviors remains completely uncharacterized. Here we show that isolated minor workers of Camponotus floridanus exhibit temperature overcompensated free-running locomotor activity rhythms under constant darkness. Under light-dark cycles, most animals are active during day and night, with a slight preference for the night. On the neurobiological level, we show that distinct cell groups in the lateral and dorsal brain of minor workers of C. floridanus are immunostained with an antibody against the clock protein Period (PER) and a lateral group additionally with an antibody against the neuropeptide pigment-dispersing factor (PDF). PER abundance oscillates in a daily manner, and PDF-positive neurites invade most parts of the brain, suggesting that the PER/PDF-positive neurons are bona fide clock neurons that transfer rhythmic signals into the relevant brain areas controlling rhythmic behavior.},

  abstract = {Swarming motility is operationally defined as multicellular, flagella-mediated surface migration of bacteria. Swarming requires intercellular interactions, surfactant secretion and an increase in flagellar numbers.Swarming motility has often been genetically bred out of laboratory strains and is best observed in natural isolates. In the laboratory, one must take care to standardize swarming conditions. Although the specific conditions that promote swarming are species dependent, swarming generally occurs on nutrient-rich media solidified by agar concentrations of greater than 0.3\%.A period of non-motility, or a swarm lag, will manifest when cells are transferred from liquid to a solid medium. The lag is thought to indicate a physiological change in cells to become swarming proficient.Some bacteria become elongated during swarming. It is not clear whether cell elongation is required for or simply co-regulated with swarming in these species. The mechanistic connection between swarming motility and cell elongation is unknown, and many swarming bacteria do not become elongated.Swarming often requires the chemotaxis sensory transduction system for functions that are unrelated to chemotaxis, or directed movement, per se.The mechanism of surface sensing (the bacterial 'sense of touch') is unknown, but swarming motility provides a strong model system for its study. Models have been proposed to explain the bacterial response to surface contact, including sensing resistance to flagellar rotation when impeded by surface contact and sensing perturbations in the Gram-negative outer membrane.The ecology of swarming is unknown, but swarming is often associated with pathogenesis. Swarming bacteria also enjoy enhanced resistance to antibiotics and eukaryotic engulfment as well as gaining enhanced nutrition and a competitive advantage from secreted surfactants.},

In diverse animal taxa, poor sleep negatively impacts development, cognitive abilities and longevity. In addition to mammals, sleep has been characterized in genetic model organisms, ranging from the nematode worm to zebrafish, and, more recently, in emergent models with simplified nervous systems such as Aplysia and jellyfish. In addition, evolutionary models ranging from fruit flies to cavefish have leveraged natural genetic variation to investigate the relationship between ecology and sleep. Here, we describe the contributions of classical and emergent genetic model systems to investigate mechanisms underlying sleep regulation. These studies highlight fundamental interactions between sleep and sensory processing, as well as a remarkable plasticity of sleep in response to environmental changes. Understanding how sleep varies throughout the animal kingdom will provide critical insight into fundamental functions and conserved genetic mechanisms underlying sleep regulation. Furthermore, identification of naturally occurring genetic variation regulating sleep may provide novel drug targets and approaches to treat sleep-related diseases.},

Despite these obvious advantages, only few bee species are nocturnal. Here we show that the sensitivity of the bee apposition eye is a major factor limiting the ability to forage in dim light. We present data on eye size, foraging times, and light levels for Megalopta genalis (Augochlorini, Halictidae) in Panama, and Lasioglossum (Sphecodogastra) sp. (Halictini, Halictidae) in Utah, USA. M. genalis females forage exclusively during twilight, but as a result of dim light levels in the rain forest, they are adapted to extremely low intensities. The likely factor limiting their foraging activity is finding their nest entrance on return from a foraging trip. The lowest light intensity at which they can do this, both in the morning and the evening, is 0.0001 cd m-2. Therefore, they leave the nest at dimmer light levels in the morning than in the evening. Lasioglossum (Sphecodogastra) foraging is limited by light intensity in the evening, but probably by temperature in the morning in the temperate climate of Utah. We propose that the evolution of nocturnality in bees was favored by the large variance in the size of females.},

To study this behavior in more detail, we tracked hungry Drosophila as they explored a large arena, focusing on the question of how flies remain near the food. To determine whether flies use external stimuli, we individually eliminated visual, olfactory, and pheromonal cues. In all cases, flies still exhibited a centralized search behavior, suggesting that none of these cues are absolutely required for navigation back to the food. To simultaneously eliminate visual and olfactory cues associated with the position of the food, we constructed an apparatus in which the food could be rapidly translated from the center of the arena. Flies continued to search around the original location, even after the food was moved to a new position. A random search model based on measured locomotor statistics could not reproduce the centered nature of the animal's trajectory. We conclude that this behavior is best explained by a form of path integration in which the flies use idiothetic cues to search near the location of the food. We argue that the use of path integration to perform a centered local search is not a specialization of Drosophila but rather represents an ancient behavioral mode that is homologous to the more elaborate foraging strategies of central place foragers such as ants.},

These oscillations in flies have been examined and found to be analogous to the gamma-waves in many respects.

Attention involves the ability to filter incoming stimuli based on their relative salience, and this is likely to require coordinated synaptic activity across the brain. This capacity may have only become possible with the evolution of related neural mechanisms that support two key sleep functions: stimulus suppression and synaptic plasticity.

We developed a high-throughput paradigm to measure visual attention in freely walking Drosophila, using competing foreground/background visual stimuli. We found that whereas sleep-deprived flies could respond normally to either stimulus alone, they were more distracted by background cues in a visual competition task. Other stressful manipulations such as starvation, heat exposure and mechanical stress had no effects on visual attention in this paradigm. In contrast to sleep deprivation, providing additional sleep using the GABA-A agonist 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo-[5,4-c]pyridine-3-ol (THIP) did not affect attention in wild-type flies, but specifically improved attention in the learning mutant dunce.

In contrast, optogenetic activation of the HS/VS motion-processing neurons in wild-type flies led to an increase in sleep following the activation, suggesting an increase in sleep pressure. Surprisingly, exposing wild-type flies to repetitive motion stimuli for extended periods did not increase sleep pressure. However, we observed that exposing flies to more complex image sequences from a movie led to more consolidated sleep, particularly when images were randomly shuffled through time. Our results suggest that specific forms of visual experience that involve motion circuits and complex, nonrepetitive imagery, drive sleep need in Drosophila.},

This method allows researchers to perform behavioral tests (e.g., learning, habituation or novel object recognition) simultaneously with two-photon microscopic imaging and/or patch-clamp recordings, all combined in a single experiment.

  abstract = {Sleep is a dynamic phenomenon that changes throughout an organism's lifetime, relating to possible age- or task-associated changes in health,learning ability, vigilance and fitness. Sleep has been identified experimentally in many animals, including honey bees (Apis mellifera). As worker bees age they change castes, typically performing a sequence of different task sets (as `cell cleaners', `nurse bees', `food storers' and `foragers'). Belonging to a caste could differentially impact the duration, constitution and periodicity of a bee's sleep. We observed individually marked bees within observation hives to determine caste dependent patterns of sleep behavior. We conducted three studies to investigate the duration and periodicity of sleep when bees were outside comb cells, as well as duration of potential sleep when bees were immobile inside cells. All four worker castes we examined exhibited a sleep state. As bees aged and changed tasks, however, they spent more time and longer uninterrupted periods in a sleep state outside cells, but spent less time and shorter uninterrupted periods immobile inside cells. Although c cleaners and nurse bees exhibited no sleep:wake rhythmicity, food storers and foragers experienced a 24 h sleep:wake cycle, with more sleep and longer unbroken bouts of sleep during the night than during the day. If immobility within cells is an indicator of sleep, our study reveals that the youngest adult bees sleep the most, with all older castes sleeping the same amount. This in-cell potential sleep may compensate for what would otherwise indicate an exceptional increase of sleep in an aging animal.},

Communication in nonhuman animals may suffer analogous degradation of precision, perhaps with especially damaging consequences for social animals. However, society-specific consequences of sleep loss have rarely been explored, and no function of sleep has been ascribed to a truly social (eusocial) organism in the context of its society. Here we show that sleep-deprived honey bees (Apis mellifera) exhibit reduced precision when signaling direction information to food sources in their waggle dances. The deterioration of the honey bee's ability to communicate is expected to reduce the foraging efficiency of nestmates. This study demonstrates the impact of sleep deprivation on signaling in a eusocial animal. If the deterioration of signals made by sleep-deprived honey bees and humans is generalizable, then imprecise communication may be one detrimental effect of sleep loss shared by social organisms.},

  abstract = {Shifts in work schedules test humans' capacity to be flexible in the timing of both work and sleep. Honeybee, Apis mellifera, foragers also shift their work schedules, but how flexible they are in the timing of sleep as they shift the timing of work is unknown, despite the importance of colony-level plasticity in the face of a changing environment. We hypothesized that sleep schedules of foragers are not fixed and instead vary depending on the time when food is available. We trained bees to visit a food source made available for several hours in the early morning (AM) or several hours in the late afternoon (PM), then monitored their sleep behaviour for 24. h after training, specifically comparing their sleep during the AM and PM periods previously designated as training periods. Following AM training, honeybee foragers slept more during the afternoon than during the morning, but following PM training, the same bees 'slept in' the next morning, and so slept more in the morning than in the afternoon. Although foragers did not change the total amount of time devoted to each of their behaviours (including sleep), the timing of their sleep did change. Thus, plasticity in timing of foraging was matched by plasticity in timing of sleep. The apparent correlation between the timing patterns of foraging and sleeping demonstrates temporal plasticity of sleep under ecologically realistic conditions in an invertebrate. Testing how shift work affects the health and performance of honeybees may shed light on the role of sleep in a nonhuman social animal. \textcopyright{} 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

  abstract = {Patterns of behavior within societies have long been visualized and interpreted using maps. Mapping the occurrence of sleep across individuals within a society could offer clues as to functional aspects of sleep. In spite of this, a detailed spatial analysis of sleep has never been conducted on an invertebrate society. We introduce the concept of mapping sleep across an insect society, and provide an empirical example, mapping sleep patterns within colonies of European honey bees (Apis mellifera L.). Honey bees face variables such as temperature and position of resources within their colony's nest that may impact their sleep. We mapped sleep behavior and temperature of worker bees and produced maps of their nest's comb contents as the colony grew and contents changed. By following marked bees, we discovered that individuals slept in many locations, but bees of different worker castes slept in different areas of the nest relative to position of the brood and surrounding temperature. Older worker bees generally slept outside cells, closer to the perimeter of the nest, in colder regions, and away from uncapped brood. Younger worker bees generally slept inside cells and closer to the center of the nest, and spent more time asleep than awake when surrounded by uncapped brood. The average surface temperature of sleeping foragers was lower than the surface temperature of their surroundings, offering a possible indicator of sleep for this caste. We propose mechanisms that could generate caste-dependent sleep patterns and discuss functional significance of these patterns. \textcopyright{} 2014 Klein et al.},

We further suggest that the capacity for safe and reliable self-intervention will play a key role in overcoming both the hard and meta-problems of consciousness.

This topic has a long history and much is known about how ants and other insects use idiothetic information, sky compasses, visual cues, and odor trails. Recent research has highlighted how insects use other sensory information for navigation, such as the olfactory cues provided by the environment. These cues are harder to understand because they submit less easily to anthropomorphic analysis. Here, we take an ecological approach, considering first what information is available to insects, then how different cues might interact, and finally we discuss potential neural correlates of these behaviors.

We tested the system precision with and without a thermocouple attached and found the precision with the sensor to be better than {$\pm$}0.01\textdegree C and the maximum possible system resolution to be 0.4 ppm. Conclusions The ultra-high-resolution DAQ system described here is inexpensive, flexible enough to be used with many different sensors, and can be built by researchers with rudimentary electronic and computer skills.

We provide two worked examples in which we apply this approach to videos of gelada monkeys and multiple species of group-living African ungulates.

A mathematical model showed that muscle action reduced the forward horizontal velocity of the landing foot during each landing. There were no statistically significant correlations of measures of landing leg motion with measures of performance. The landing prior to the jump phase was less active than the two preceding landings. However, the elite athletes in the present study were much more active in this landing than athletes of lesser ability. There was also some indication among the subjects of this study that activeness in this landing was associated with long triple jumps. Thus, activeness in this landing appears to be desirable but very difficult to achieve and/or use effectively.}

Such lack of invertebrate studies might be due to a traditional belief that invertebrates are just 'minirobots'. Lately, studies highlighting personality differences in a range of invertebrate species have challenged this idea. However, the number of invertebrate species investigated still contrasts markedly with the effort that has been made studying vertebrates, which represent only a single subphylum. We describe how investigating proximate, evolutionary and ecological correlates of personality variation in invertebrates may broaden our understanding of personality variation in general. In our opinion, personality studies on invertebrates are much needed, because invertebrates exhibit a range of aspects in their life histories, social and sexual behaviours that are extremely rare or absent in most studied vertebrates, but that offer new avenues for personality research. Examples are complete metamorphosis, male emasculation during copulation, asexual reproduction, eusociality and parasitism. Further invertebrate personality studies could enable a comparative approach to unravel how past selective forces have driven the evolution of personality differences. Finally, we point out the advantages of studying personality variation in many invertebrate species, such as easier access to relevant data on proximate and ultimate factors, arising from easy maintenance, fast life cycles and short generation times. \textcopyright{} 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

  abstract = {SYNOPSIS. Most physiological and ecological approaches to animal locomotion are based on steady state assumptions, yet movements of many animals are interspersed with pauses lasting from milliseconds to minutes. Thus, pauses, along with changes in the duration and speed of moves, form part of a dynamic system of intermittent locomotion by which animals adjust their locomotor behavior to changing circumstances. Intermittent locomotion occurs in a wide array of organisms from protozoans to mammals. It is found in aerial, aquatic and terrestrial locomotion and in many behavioral contexts including search and pursuit of prey, mate search, escape from predators, habitat assessment and general travel. In our survey, animals exhibiting intermittent locomotion paused on average nearly 50\% of their locomotion time (range 6-94\%). Although intermittent locomotion is usually expected to increase energetic costs as a result of additional expenditure for acceleration and deceleration, a variety of tnergetic benefits can arise when forward movement continues during pauses. Endurance also can be improved by partial recovery from fatigue during pauses. Perceptual benefits can arise because pauses increase the capacity of the sensory systems to detect relevant stimuli. Several processes, including velocity blur, relative motion detection, fov\'eation, attention and interference between sensory systems are probably involved. In animals that do not pause, alternative mechanisms for stabilizing the perceptual field are often present. Because movement is an important cue for stimulus detection, pauses can also reduce unwanted detection by an organism's predators or prey. Several models have attempted to integrate energetic and perceptual processes, but many challenges remain. Future advances will require improved quantification of the effects of speed on perception.}

  abstract = {The respiratory exchange of mature males of the Desert Locust Schistocerca gregaria (Forsk\aa l) has been studied during tethered flight in a small container and compared with the exchange before and after flights of varying duration. All determinations were based on gas analyses, and so the CO2 output and the O2 uptake were determined simultaneously. The accuracy of the analytical procedure has been discussed and the determinations of the R.Q. before and during flight found to be valid. The figures of the oxygen consumption are reduced to N.T.P.1. During rest at 27-30\textdegree C the oxygen consumption amounted to 0.63 l. O2/kg./hr., which means that an average male of 1.8 g. consumed 18 cu.mm. O2 per min. During flight, however, the consumption increased fifteen to fifty times, the corresponding figures being 10-30 l. O2/kg./hr. or 300-900 cu.mm. O2 per min. in an average male.2. After even a short period (10 min.) of flight in a roundabout or in front of a wind tunnel a distinct `oxygen debt' was demonstrated. After prolonged flight (90-195 min.) the `debt' was nearly doubled. It corresponded to 0.3-0.7 l. O2/kg. or to the oxygen consumption during only 0.5-1.5 min. of flight, so that anaerobic processes could not amount to much. It was characteristic that the recovery lasted at least 1 hr.3. The R.Q. in resting animals averaged 0.82, and during the first 30 min. of flight the same value was obtained, but during the following 60 min. a statistically significant decrease of the R.Q. could be demonstrated, the average value in this period being 0.75. This unexpected result strongly indicates that, unlike other insects investigated so far, locusts utilize mainly fat as a source of energy during sustained flight.4. It is suggested that a surplus of ketone bodies caused by the intensive breakdown of fats might explain the prolonged recovery of 1-2 hr. duration in Schistocerca, the recovery after flight in Drosophila which fly on carbohydrate lasting only 2 min. or less in spite of the same relative rate of combustion.},

High throughput genotyping, genotyping by sequencing and genomic breeding are becoming a standard in plant breeding. As a result, the collection of phenotypic data is increasingly becoming a limiting factor in plant breeding. Genetic studies on root traits are being hampered by the complexity of these traits and the inaccessibility of the rhizosphere. With an increasing interest in phenotyping, breeders and scientists try to overcome these limitations, resulting in impressive developments in automated phenotyping platforms. Recently, many such platforms have been thoroughly described, yet their efficiency to increase genetic gain often remains undiscussed. This efficiency depends on the heritability of the phenotyped traits as well as the correlation of these traits with agronomically relevant breeding targets. This review provides an overview of the latest developments in root phenotyping and describes the environmental and genetic factors influencing root phenotype and heritability. It also intends to give direction to future phenotyping and breeding strategies for optimizing root system functioning. A quantitative framework to determine the efficiency of phenotyping platforms for genetic gain is described. By increasing heritability, managing effects caused by interactions between genotype and environment and by quantifying the genetic relation between traits phenotyped in platforms and ultimate breeding targets, phenotyping platforms can be utilized to their maximum potential.},

  abstract = {Circadian clocks play conserved roles in gating sleep and wake states throughout the day-night cycle [1\textendash 5]. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, DN1p clock neurons have been reported to play both wake- and sleep-promoting roles [6\textendash 11], suggesting a complex coupling of DN1p neurons to downstream sleep and arousal centers. However, the circuit logic by which DN1p neurons modulate sleep remains poorly understood. Here, we show that DN1p neurons can be divided into two morphologically distinct subsets. Projections from one subset surround the pars intercerebralis, a previously defined circadian output region [12]. In contrast, the second subset also sends presynaptic termini to a visual processing center, the anterior optic tubercle (AOTU) [13]. Within the AOTU, we find that DN1p neurons inhibit a class of tubercular-bulbar (TuBu) neurons that act to promote consolidated sleep. These TuBu neurons in turn form synaptic connections with R neurons of the ellipsoid body, a region linked to visual feature detection, locomotion, spatial memory, and sleep homeostasis [14\textendash 17]. Our results define a second output arm from DN1p neurons and suggest a role for TuBu neurons as regulators of sleep drive. DN1p clock neurons in the fruit fly, Drosophila, promote wakefulness in the morning. Lamaze et al. show that DN1p neurons inhibit a class of sleep-promoting tubercular-bulbar neurons. These in turn are connected to ring neurons in the ellipsoid body, a neuropil domain that influences sleep, visual navigation, and spatial memory.},

  abstract = {Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) involves recording the sounds of animals and environments for research and conservation. PAM is used in a range of contexts across terrestrial, marine and freshwater environments. However, financial constraints limit applications within aquatic environments; these costs include the high cost of submersible acoustic recorders. We quantify this financial constraint using a systematic literature review of all ecoacoustic studies published in 2020, demonstrating that commercially available autonomous underwater recording units are, on average, five times more expensive than their terrestrial equivalents. This pattern is more extreme at the low end of the price range; the cheapest available aquatic autonomous units are over 40 times more expensive than their terrestrial counterparts. Following this, we test a prototype low-cost, low-specification aquatic recorder called the `HydroMoth': this device is a modified version of a widely used terrestrial recorder (AudioMoth), altered to include a waterproof case and customisable gain settings suitable for a range of aquatic applications. We test the performance of the HydroMoth in both aquaria and field conditions, recording artificial and natural sounds, and comparing outputs with identical recordings taken with commercially available hydrophones. Although the signal-to-noise ratio and the recording quality of HydroMoths are lower than commercially available hydrophones, the recordings with HydroMoths still allow for the identification of different fish and marine mammal species, as well as the calculation of ecoacoustic indices for ecosystem monitoring. Finally, we outline the potential applications of low-cost, low-specification underwater sound recorders for bioacoustic studies, discuss their likely limitations, and present important considerations of which users should be aware. Several performance limitations and a lack of professional technical support mean that low-cost devices cannot meet the requirements of all PAM applications. Despite these limitations, however, HydroMoth facilitates underwater recording at a fraction of the price of existing hydrophones, creating exciting potential for diverse involvement in aquatic bioacoustics worldwide.},

The precision of the animals activity periods was computed by periodogram analysis. In DD and LL of 10-4 lux the rhythm of locomotor activity of L. navarricus is extinct or very unprecise, in LL of 10-2 and 100 lux the periods are much more exact. L. oblongus is always periodically active under DD and weak LL conditions; like L. navarricus its activity periods are more precise in brighter LL. On the other hand the activity periods of L. terricola are relatively precise in DD and LL of 10-4 lux and become more unprecise in increasing light intensity. More than 50\% of the tested animals were synchronised by LDs of 010-4. 010-2, and 0100 lux. Because of the extreme light sensitivity of their circadian system, the three species are adapted to twilight habitats (cave entrances). Because of its aperiodicity under DD conditions L. navarricus is additionally adapted to a life in constant darkness (inside of caves). For this and other physiological and morphological reasons the troglobite L. navarricus represents a relatively early stage of regressive evolution under cave conditions.},

Underlying the performance of such a remarkable predator is a finely tuned visual system capable of tracking targets amidst distractors and background clutter. The dragonfly performs a complex repertoire of flight behaviours, from near-motionless hovering to acute turns at high speeds. Here, we review the optical, neuronal, and behavioural adaptations that underlie the dragonflies' ability to achieve such remarkable predatory success.},

  abstract = {Nearly all animals with good vision have a repertoire of eye movements. The majority show a pattern of stable fixations with fast saccades that shift the direction of gaze. These movements may be made by the eyes themselves, or the head, or in some insects the whole body. The main reason for keeping gaze still during fixations is the need to avoid the blur that results from the long response time of the photoreceptors. Blur begins to degrade the image at a retinal velocity of about 1 receptor acceptance angle per response time. Some insects (e.g. hoverflies) stabilise their gaze much more rigidly than this rule implies, and it is suggested that the need to see the motion of small objects against a background imposes even more stringent conditions on image motion. A third reason for preventing rotational image motion is to prevent contamination of the translational flow-field, by which a moving animal can judge its heading and the distances of objects. Some animals do let their eyes rotate smoothly, and these include some heteropod molluscs, mantis shrimps and jumping spiders, all of which have narrow linear retinae which scan across the surroundings. Hymenopteran insects also rotate during orientation flights at speeds of 100-200 degrees s-1. This is just consistent with a blur-free image, as are the scanning speeds of the animals with linear retinae.},

The most fundamental question that can be asked of a sample of circular data is whether it suggests that the underlying population is uniformly distributed around the circle, or whether it is concentrated around at least one preferred direction (e.g. a migratory goal or activity phase). We compared the statistical power of five commonly used tests (the Rayleigh test, the V-test, Watson's test, Kuiper's test and Rao's spacing test) across a range of different unimodal scenarios. The V-test showed higher power for symmetrical distributions, Rao's spacing performed worst for all explored unimodal distributions tested and the remaining three tests showed very similar performance. However, the V-test only applies if the hypothesis is restricted to one (pre-specified) direction of interest. In all other unimodal cases, we recommend using the Rayleigh test. Much less explored is the multimodal case with data concentrated around several directions. We performed power simulations for a variety of multimodal situations, testing the performance of the widely used Rayleigh, Rao's, Watson, and Kuiper's tests as well as the more recent Bogdan and Hermans-Rasson tests. Our analyses of alternative statistical methods show that the commonly used tests lack statistical power in many of multimodal cases. Transformation of the raw data (e.g. doubling the angles) can overcome some of the issues, but only in the case of perfect f-fold symmetry. However, the Hermans-Rasson method, which is not yet implemented in any software package, outcompetes the alternative tests (often by substantial margins) in most of the multimodal situations explored. We recommend the wider uptake of the powerful but hitherto neglected Hermans-Rasson method. In summary, we provide guidance for biologists helping them to make decisions when testing circular data for single or multiple departures from uniformity.},

They are also noisy and variable, but we can classify and identify them well. This means that the olfactory system must solve complicated pattern-learning and pattern-recognition problems. I propose that part of the solution relies on a particular architecture that imposes a dynamic format on odour codes. According to this hypothesis, the olfactory system actively creates a large coding space in which to place odour representations and simultaneously optimizes their distribution within it. This process uses both oscillatory and non-periodic dynamic processes with complementary functions: slow non-periodic processes underlie decorrelation, whereas fast oscillations allow sparsening and feature binding. \textcopyright{} 2002 Macmillan Magazines Ltd.},

Several performances of each of six finalists were recorded on cine-film at 100 Hz. Resulting planar kinematic data were obtained for the last stride, touch-down and take-off. For the analysis, the point of maximum knee flexion was established and this was used to represent the point at which the compression phase had ended. A variety of variables describing the position, velocity and angular changes are presented as descriptive data. In addition, these were used to compute energies on the basis of a whole body model. The data were interpreted on the basis of a technique model of long jumping established from the literature. It was confirmed that take-off velocity was a function of touch-down velocity, and that there was an increase in vertical velocity at the expense of a reduction of horizontal velocity. An attempt was made to identify the mechanisms acting during the touchdown to take-off phase which were responsible for generating vertical velocity. It was concluded that there was evidence for mechanical, biomechanical and muscular mechanisms. The former relates to the generation of vertical velocity by the body riding over the base of support; the second is the elastic re-utilization of energy; and the third is the contribution by concentric muscular contraction. \textcopyright{} 1993 E. \& F.N.

This has led to a model in which the negative effects of irregular light on mood and cognitive functions are secondary to circadian and/or sleep disruptions.However, light can also directly influence mood and learning without causing circadian arrhythmicity or sleep disruptions.Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) project to a wide range of brain regions, including areas that have been associated with mood and anxiety. These cells emerge as leading candidates for mediating the direct effects of irregular light on mood.Rodent models have been used to define the mechanisms involved in the effects of light on circadian rhythms, sleep and mood. Several animal models and light schedules were used to recapitulate important aspects of irregular light schedules observed in humans, which cause mood and cognitive disorders.A better understanding of the connections that ipRGCs form in the brain and their influence on circadian, sleep and mood controlling centres will be the first step to determine the comprehensive role of light on these complex, inter-related behaviours.},

Here, we reassess these influential correlates of mammalian sleep using the formal phylogenetic framework of independent contrasts. After controlling for phylogeny using this procedure, the interpretation of many of the correlates changed. For instance, and contrary to previous studies, we found interspecific support for a neurophysiological role for rapid-eye-movement sleep, such as memory consolidation. Also in contrast to previous studies, we did not find comparative support for an energy conservation function for slow-wave sleep.

We also discuss how ecological factors, such as predation risk, have shaped sleep in prey and the growing literature on the influences of light pollution on sleep in humans and wildlife. Lastly, we highlight recent studies on species that can forgo sleep for extended periods of time and, by doing so, challenge notions about the adaptive value of sleep. Whenever possible, we interpret evolutionary patterns in the light of functional hypotheses for sleep. Throughout, we emphasize the unique contribution that comparative sleep research has made to our broader understanding of sleep and sleep functions.},

  abstract = {The physical basis of consciousness remains one of the most elusive concepts in current science. One influential conjecture is that consciousness is to do with some form of causality, measurable through information. The integrated information theory of consciousness (IIT) proposes that conscious experience, filled with rich and specific content, corresponds directly to a hierarchically organised, irreducible pattern of causal interactions; i.e. an integrated informational structure among elements of a system. Here, we tested this conjecture in a simple biological system (fruit flies), estimating the information structure of the system during wakefulness and general anesthesia. Consistent with this conjecture, we found that integrated interactions among populations of neurons during wakefulness collapsed to isolated clusters of interactions during anesthesia. We used classification analysis to quantify the accuracy of discrimination between wakeful and anesthetised states, and found that informational structures inferred conscious states with greater accuracy than a scalar summary of the structure, a measure which is generally championed as the main measure of IIT. In stark contrast to a view which assumes feedforward architecture for insect brains, especially fly visual systems, we found rich information structures, which cannot arise from purely feedforward systems, occurred across the fly brain. Further, these information structures collapsed uniformly across the brain during anesthesia. Our results speak to the potential utility of the novel concept of an ``informational structure'' as a measure for level of consciousness, above and beyond simple scalar values.},

Since consolidation occurs during sleep, even fleeting experiences when animals are awakened may produce maladaptive long-term memory, or may interrupt consolidation. In a learning paradigm affecting Aplysia feeding, when animals were trained after being awakened from sleep, interactions between new experiences and consolidation were prevented by blocking long-term memory arising from the new experiences. Inhibiting protein synthesis eliminated the block and allowed even a brief, generally ineffective training to produce long-term memory. Memory formation depended on consolidative proteins already expressed before training. After effective training, long term memory required subsequent transcription and translation. Memory formation during the sleep phase was correlated with increased CREB1 transcription, but not CREB2 transcription. Increased C/EBP transcription was a correlate of both effective and ineffective training and of treatments not producing memory.},

Six EEG channels were used to account for the topographical aspect of the analysis. Validity of the results was supported by considering a wide dataset of 174 subjects with normal sleep. Subjects spent two consecutive nights in the sleep laboratory during which EEG recordings were obtained. High similarity between average spectra of two consecutive nights was found considering an individual.

This is reflected in the switching of the membrane potential of the stimulated neuron from slow UP/DOWN oscillations to a persistent-UP state or vice versa, with concurrent changes in the temporal pattern of cortical local field potential (LFP) recorded several millimeters away.

Here, we report that Drosophila has eye-mediated photoentrainment via a parallel pacemaker neuron organization. Patch-clamp recordings of central circadian pacemaker neurons reveal that light excites most of them independently of one another. We also show that light-responding pacemaker neurons send their dendrites to a neuropil called accessary medulla (aMe), where they make monosynaptic connections with Hofbauer\textendash Buchner eyelet photoreceptors and interneurons that transmit compound-eye signals. Laser ablation of aMe and eye removal both abolish light responses of circadian pacemaker neurons, revealing aMe as a hub to channel eye inputs to central circadian clock. Taken together, we demonstrate that the central clock receives eye inputs via hub-organized parallel circuits in Drosophila.},

Previously, it has been shown that when bumblebees encounter sudden changes in the proximity to nearby surfaces \textendash{} as indicated by a change in the magnitude of optic flow on each side of the visual field \textendash{} they adjust their flight speed well before the change, suggesting that they measure optic flow for speed control at low visual angles in the frontal visual field. Here, we investigated the effect that sudden changes in the magnitude of translational optic flow have on both position and speed control in bumblebees if these changes are asymmetrical; that is, if they occur only on one side of the visual field. Our results reveal that the visual region over which bumblebees respond to optic flow cues for flight control is not dictated by a set viewing angle. Instead, bumblebees appear to use the maximum magnitude of translational optic flow experienced in the frontal visual field. This strategy ensures that bumblebees use the translational optic flow generated by the nearest obstacles \textendash{} that is, those with which they have the highest risk of colliding \textendash{} to control flight.},

The high-frequency part of the signal ({$\greaterequivlnt$}500 Hz), i.e., the multi-unit activity (MUA), contains information about the firing of action potentials in surrounding neurons, while the low-frequency part, the local field potential (LFP), contains information about how these neurons integrate synaptic inputs. As the recorded extracellular signals arise from multiple neural processes, their interpretation is typically ambiguous and difficult. Fortunately, a precise biophysical modeling scheme linking activity at the cellular level and the recorded signal has been established: the extracellular potential can be calculated as a weighted sum of all transmembrane currents in all cells located in the vicinity of the electrode. This computational scheme can considerably aid the modeling and analysis of MUA and LFP signals. Here, we describe LFPy, an open source Python package for numerical simulations of extracellular potentials. LFPy consists of a set of easy-to-use classes for defining cells, synapses and recording electrodes as Python objects, implementing this biophysical modeling scheme. It runs on top of the widely used NEURON simulation environment, which allows for flexible usage of both new and existing cell models. Further, calculation of extracellular potentials using the line-source-method is efficiently implemented. We describe the theoretical framework underlying the extracellular potential calculations and illustrate by examples how LFPy can be used both for simulating LFPs, i.e., synaptic contributions from single cells as well a populations of cells, and MUAs, i.e., extracellular signatures of action potentials.},

The animals ran in a straight respirometric chamber in which locomotor speed and CO2 release were monitored simultaneously using flow-through respirometry and conventional video analysis. In resting intact ants, standard metabolic rate was on average 0.32 ml CO2 g-1 body mass h-1. During walking, the ants breathed continuously and metabolic rate increased between 4.3 times (level walking at 0-5 mm s-1) and 6.9 times (30\dbend{} ascent at 85-95 mm s-1) over resting rates. Metabolic rate increased linearly with increasing walking speed but superficially leveled off beyond speeds of about 70 mm s-1. Walking on incline (uphill) or decline slopes (downhill) of up to 60\dbend{} had only a small effect on energy consumption compared to level walking. During slope walking, total metabolic rate averaged over all running speeds ranged from a minimum of 1.55\dbend 0.4 (horizontal running) to a maximum of 1.89\dbend 0.7 ml CO2 h-1 g-1 body mass (30\dbend{} downhill). The mean cost of transport in Camponotus was approximately 130 J g-1 km-1.

  abstract = {The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is a diurnal insect active during the day with consolidated sleep at night. Social interactions between pairs of flies have been shown to affect locomotor activity patterns, but effects on locomotion and sleep patterns have not been assessed for larger populations. Here, we use a commercially available locomotor activity monitor (LAM25H) system to record and analyze sleep behavior. Surprisingly, we find that same-sex populations of flies synchronize their sleep/wake activity, resulting in a population sleep pattern, which is similar but not identical to that of isolated individuals. Like individual flies, groups of flies show circadian and homeostatic regulation of sleep, as well as sexual dimorphism in sleep pattern and sensitivity to starvation and a known sleep-disrupting mutation (amnesiac). Populations of flies, however, exhibit distinct sleep characteristics from individuals. Differences in sleep appear to be due to olfaction-dependent social interactions and change with population size and sex ratio. These data support the idea that it is possible to investigate neural mechanisms underlying the effects of population behaviors on sleep by directly looking at a large number of animals in laboratory conditions.},

The dynamical patterns and functions of these brief awakenings from sleep are not well understood, and they often are viewed as disruptions (random or pathologic) of the sleep process. In this article, we hypothesize that brief awakenings from sleep may reflect aspects of the endogenous sleep control mechanism and thus may exhibit certain robust dynamical patterns across species. We analyze sleep recordings from mice, rats, cats, and humans, and we compare the distributions of sleep and wake episode durations. For all four species, we find that durations of brief wake episodes during the sleep period exhibit a scale-free power-law behavior with an exponent a that remains the same for all species ({$\alpha$} {$\approx$} 2.2). In contrast, sleep episode durations for all four species follow exponential distributions with characteristic time scales, which change across species in relation to body mass and metabolic rate. Our findings suggest common dynamical features of brief awakenings and sleep durations across species and may provide insights into the dynamics of the neural circuits controlling sleep.},

The investigation was performed with a new technique in which the intensity and the duration of the behaviour pattern were measured in an objective and automatic way. Workers of formicine ants eiect a mixture of formic acid and the secretion from Dufour's gland against an enemy. The secretion from this gland in F. rufa consists of a great number of substances, 39 of which have been identified. The dominating substances form a homologous series of aliphatic, saturated hydrocarbons. Some of these hydrocarbons as well as the formic acid are alarm pheromones. The behavioural threshold value for one of these compounds, decane, was lower than 5.1013 molecules cm-3 air. The threshold value for formic acid was estimated to 7.1015 molecules cm-3 air. Formic acid and undecane are shown to belong to different reaction groups. The hydrocarbons, on the other hand, seem to affect the same kind of acceptor or receptor. The total intensity and duration of the alarm behaviour released by formic acid and one hydrocarbon are additive if the two substances are combined in a stimulus. A combination of two hydrocarbons and formic acid release a stronger behaviour than one hydrocarbon with formic acid even when the two stimuli contain the same number of molecules. The hydrocarbons have a combined effect and their relative concentrations regulate the intensity and duration of the alarm behaviour. \textcopyright{} 1976.}

  abstract = {applied a high-temperature (50 \textdegree C) incubation to enhance diffusion , before lowering the temperature to 37 \textdegree C for efficient hybrid-ization. To improve the signal-to-noise ratio, we quenched the autofluorescence using sodium borohydride and optically cleared the tissue with xylene. (Supplementary Fig. 1). The method did not require molecular amplification, could be performed in 2 d, and was compatible with immunostaining (Supplementary Fig. 2). A stepwise protocol and comparison with pre-existing approaches are described in the Supplementary Protocol, Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Figure 1. To validate the specificity of our approach, we compared wild-type with transgenic flies in which GFP was expressed in neurons expressing pigment-dispersing factor (PDF). PDF neurons are part of the circadian pacemaker network and consist of two groups, four large ventrolateral neurons (l-LNvs) and four small ventrolateral neurons (s-LNvs), in each hemisphere 8. Brains labeled with FISH probes targeting GFP and PDF mRNAs with different dyes were imaged on a confocal microscope and revealed the characteristic two groups of l-LNvs and s-LNvs on each side of the brain. GFP-coding mRNA signal was not observed outside of the PDF neurons or in wild-type flies, confirming the specificity of the hybridization (Fig. 1b). To determine whether we could resolve lower-abundance mRNAs, we probed timeless (tim) mRNA, which codes for a transcription factor that cycles daily 9 and regulates the circadian cycle. We acquired confocal images of wild-type files entrained at zeitgeber times (ZT) 2 and 14, and we observed a strong tim signal in PDF neurons at ZT14, whereas the intensity was much lower at ZT2, consistent with previous reports (Fig. 1c,d and Supplementary Fig. 3) 10,11. Because of its multiplexing potential, the technique lends itself to multiple applications. FISH can be a powerful characterization and validation tool for the rapidly expanding collections of genetic lines used in neuroscience and optogenetics. Three split-Gal4 fly lines with expression in cell types (Mi1, Mi4, Mi9) 12 with known neurotransmitter expression (F.P. Davis, S.R. Eddy and G.L. Henry, personal communication) were crossed with the UAS-myr::HaloTag line to generate expression of a HaloTag reporter in the desired neurons 13. The HaloTag protein was labeled with a fluorescent ligand (Online Methods), and FISH probes were simultaneously hybridized to mRNAs from genes involved in distinct neurotransmitter pathways (Gad1, vGlut and Chat, associated with GABAergic, glutamatergic and cholinergic transmission , respectively) labeled with three different dyes. The overlap between the neurons containing the HaloTag and those with the FISH signals confirmed the expected neurotransmitter signatures (Supplementary Fig. 4). We then interrogated the expression of the three genes associated with distinct neurotransmitter pathways. We describe a fluorescence in situ hybridization method that permits detection of the localization and abundance of single mrnas (smfish) in cleared whole-mount adult Drosophila brains. the approach is rapid and multiplexable and does not require molecular amplification; it allows facile quantification of mrna expression with subcellular resolution on a standard confocal microscope. We further demonstrate single-mrna detection across the entire brain using a custom bessel beam structured illumination microscope (bb-sim). Brain development and function require the expression of select genes at specific times in appropriate neurons. Because of the wealth of genetic tools available, Drosophila has emerged as an important model system for identifying the gene networks underlying neu-ron types and functions 1-3. Existing approaches that quantify gene expression using sequencing methods mainly rely on isolated cell populations, in which neurons are extracted from their native context. RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a powerful technique that allows measurement of mRNA levels with subcellular resolution within preserved tissue 4-6 , but its application to adult Drosophila brains has proved difficult owing to limited probe penetration and sample autofluorescence. Here we develop a simplified, robust whole-mount RNA FISH method for adult Drosophila brains that connects gene expression with neuronal identity and functional anatomy. Whole-mount imaging is advantageous as compared to sectioning-based methods because it does not require extensive sample preparation (serial sectioning, labeling, mounting, imaging) or post-imaging analysis (stitching, registration). By optimizing processing and clearing, we demonstrate whole-brain multiplexed mRNA quantification using a standard confocal microscope. Upon imaging with a custom Bessel beam structured illumination microscope , individual mRNA molecules can be detected and counted throughout the entire cleared brain. An overview of the method is shown in Figure 1a. To facilitate probe penetration, we treated the tissue with 5\% acetic acid 7 and},

  abstract = {Active locomotive states are metabolically expensive and require efficient sensory processing both to avoid wasteful movements and to cope with an extended bandwidth of sensory stimuli. This is particularly true for flying animals because flight, as opposed to walking or resting, imposes a steplike increase in metabolism for the precise execution and control of movements. Sensory processing itself carries a significant metabolic cost, but the principles governing the adjustment of sensory processing to different locomotor states are not well understood. We use the blowfly as a model system to study the impact on visual processing of a neuromodulator, octopamine, which is known to be involved in the regulation of flight physiology. We applied an octopamine agonist and recorded the directional motion responses of identified visual interneurons known to process self-motion-induced optic flow to directional motion stimuli. The neural response range of these neurons is increased and the response latency is reduced. We also found that, due to an elevated spontaneous spike rate, the cells' negative signaling range is increased. Meanwhile, the preferred self-motion parameters the cells encode were state independent. Our results indicate that in the blowfly energetically expensive sensory coding strategies, such as rapid, large responses, and high spontaneous spike activity could be adjusted by the neuromodulator octopamine, likely to save energy during quiet locomotor states.

  abstract = {Flying generates predictably different patterns of optic flow compared with other locomotor states. A sensorimotor system tuned to rapid responses and a high bandwidth of optic flow would help the animal to avoid wasting energy through imprecise motor action. However, neural processing that covers a higher input bandwidth itself comes at higher energetic costs which would be a poor investment when the animal was not flying. How does the blowfly adjust the dynamic range of its optic flow-processing neurons to the locomotor state? Octopamine (OA) is a biogenic amine central to the initiation and maintenance of flight in insects. We used an OA agonist chlordimeform (CDM) to simulate the widespread OA release during flight and recorded the effects on the temporal frequency coding of the H2 cell. This cell is a visual interneuron known to be involved in flight stabilization reflexes. The application of CDM resulted in i) an increase in the cell's spontaneous activity, expanding the inhibitory signalling range ii) an initial response gain to moving gratings (20 \textendash{} 60 ms post-stimulus) that depended on the temporal frequency of the grating and iii) a reduction in the rate and magnitude of motion adaptation that was also temporal frequency-dependent. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that the application of a neuromodulator can induce velocity-dependent alterations in the gain of a wide-field optic flow-processing neuron. The observed changes in the cell's response properties resulted in a 33\% increase of the cell's information rate when encoding random changes in temporal frequency of the stimulus. The increased signalling range and more rapid, longer lasting responses employed more spikes to encode each bit, and so consumed a greater amount of energy. It appears that for the fly investing more energy in sensory processing during flight is more efficient than wasting energy on under-performing motor control.},

Neural signaling is metabolically costly [5-9], and a hungry animal has limited energy reserves, so we hypothesized that neural activity in other systems may be downregulated by food deprivation. We investigated this hypothesis in the motion vision pathway of the blowfly. Like other animals [10-17], flies augment their motion vision when moving: they increase the resting activity and gain of visual interneurons supporting the control of locomotion and gaze [18-21]. In the present study, walking-induced changes in visual processing depended on the nutritional state - they decreased with food deprivation and recovered after subsequent feeding. We found that changes in the motion vision pathway depended on walking speed in a manner dependent on the nutritional state. Walking also reduced response latencies in visual interneurons, an effect not altered by food deprivation. Finally, the optomotor reflex that compensates for visual wide-field motion was reduced in food-deprived flies. Thus, walking augmented motion vision, but the effect was decreased when energy reserves were low. Our results suggest that energy limitations may drive the rebalancing of neural activity with changes in the nutritional state. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Using Jeffreys's Bayes factor hypothesis tests, researchers can grade the decisiveness of the evidence that the data provide for a point null hypothesis H0 versus a composite alternative hypothesis H1. Consequently, Jeffreys's tests are of considerable theoretical and practical relevance for empirical researchers in general and for experimental psychologists in particular. To highlight this relevance and to facilitate the interpretation and use of Jeffreys's Bayes factor tests we focus on two common inferential scenarios: testing the nullity of a normal mean (i.e., the Bayesian equivalent of the t-test) and testing the nullity of a correlation. For both Bayes factor tests, we explain their development, we extend them to one-sided problems, and we apply them to concrete examples from experimental psychology.},

The fundamental question of why our nervous systems have evolved to require sleep remains a topic of ongoing scientific deliberation. This question is largely being addressed by research using animal models of sleep. Drosophila melanogaster, also known as the common fruit fly, exhibits a sleep state that shares common features with many other species. Drosophila sleep studies have unearthed an immense wealth of knowledge about the neuroscience of sleep. Given the breadth of findings published on Drosophila sleep, it is important to consider how all of this information might come together to generate a more holistic understanding of sleep. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the neurobiology of Drosophila sleep and explores the broader insights and implications of how sleep is regulated across species and why it is necessary for the brain.},

Organisms inhabiting largely arrhythmic environments, such as caves, offer a unique opportunity to study the evolution of circadian rhythms in response to changing ecological pressures. Populations of the Mexican tetra, Astyanax mexicanus, have repeatedly invaded caves from surface rivers, where individuals must contend with perpetual darkness, reduced food availability, and limited fluctuations in daily environmental cues. To investigate the molecular basis for evolved changes in circadian rhythms, we investigated rhythmic transcription across multiple independently-evolved cavefish populations. Our findings reveal that evolution in a cave environment has led to the repeated disruption of the endogenous biological clock, and its entrainment by light. The circadian transcriptome shows widespread reductions and losses of rhythmic transcription and changes to the timing of the activation/repression of core-transcriptional clock. In addition to dysregulation of the core clock, we find that rhythmic transcription of the melatonin regulator aanat2 and melatonin rhythms are disrupted in cavefish under darkness. Mutants of aanat2 and core clock gene rorca disrupt diurnal regulation of sleep in A. mexicanus, phenocopying circadian modulation of sleep and activity phenotypes of cave populations. Together, these findings reveal multiple independent mechanisms for loss of circadian rhythms in cavefish populations and provide a platform for studying how evolved changes in the biological clock can contribute to variation in sleep and circadian behavior.},

Current eco-acoustic research focuses on automatic audio recorder arrays and acoustic indices, which may be used to study the spatial and temporal dynamics of local animal communities in high resolution. While such soundscapes have often been studied above ground, their applicability in soils has rarely been tested. For the first time, we applied acoustic and statistical methods to explore the spatial, diurnal, and seasonal dynamics of the soundscape in soils. We studied the dynamics of acoustic complexity in forest soils in the alpine Pfynwald forest in the Swiss canton of Valais and related them to meteorological and microclimatic data. To increase microclimatic variability, we used a long-term irrigation experiment. We also took soil samples close to the sensors on 6 days in different seasons. Daily and seasonal patterns of acoustic complexity were predicted to be associated with abiotic parameters\textemdash that is, meteorological and microclimatic conditions\textemdash and mediated by the dynamics of the diversity and activity of the soil fauna. Seasonal patterns in acoustic complexity showed the highest acoustic complexity values in spring and summer, decreasing in fall and winter. Diurnal acoustic complexity values were highest in the afternoon and lowest during the night. The measurement of acoustic diversity at the sampling site was significantly associated with soil communities, with relationships between taxa richness or community composition and acoustic complexity being strongest shortly before taking the soil samples. Our results suggest that the temporal and spatial dynamics of the diversity and community composition of soil organisms can be predicted by the acoustic complexity of soil soundscapes. This opens up the possibility of using soil soundscape analysis as a noninvasive and easy-to-use method for soil biodiversity monitoring programs.},

We found that the peak-to-peak responses of a class of visual motion-processing interneurons, the vertical-system visual neurons (VS cells), doubled when flies were flying compared with when they were at rest. Thus, the gain of the VS cells is not fixed, but is instead behaviorally flexible and changes with locomotor state. Using voltage clamp, we found that the passive membrane resistance of VS cells was reduced during flight, suggesting that the elevated gain was a result of increased synaptic drive from upstream motion-sensitive inputs. The ability to perform patch-clamp recordings in behaving Drosophila promises to help unify the understanding of behavior at the gene, cell and circuit levels.},

Measures to control and perhaps to stop and reverse such invasive processes are urgently needed. Mathematical models are a suitable tool to preview the impact of control measures before utilizing them in nature. Here, a reaction-diffusion model is used to describe the competition and dispersal of invasive and native species. Not only the environment is changing but also growth, harvesting and dispersal of the two competitors vary in space and time. Extreme events such as fires or landslides or any other processes yielding bare re-invadable ground lead to temporary extinction of both species at a randomly chosen time and spatial range. The spatiotemporal dimension of these extreme fragmentation events, the ratio of the dispersal rates of the competing species as well as the selective removal of the invader turn out to be the crucial driving forces of the system dynamics. Finally, the controlling effect of a targeted infection of the invasive species with a specific pathogen is studied in an eco-epidemiological competition-diffusion model. \textcopyright{} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Yet, the harsh working conditions of these environments and the uniqueness of the subterranean organisms have challenged most attempts to pursuit standardized research. Two main obstacles have synergistically hampered previous attempts. First, there is a habitat impediment related to the objective difficulties of exploring subterranean habitats and our inability to access the network of fissures that represents the elective habitat for the so-called ``cave species.'' Second, there is a biological impediment illustrated by the rarity of most subterranean species and their low physiological tolerance, often limiting sample size and complicating laboratory experiments. We explore the advantages and disadvantages of four general experimental setups (in situ, quasi in situ, ex situ, and in silico) in the light of habitat and biological impediments. We also discuss the potential of indirect approaches to research. Furthermore, using bibliometric data, we provide a quantitative overview of the model organisms that scientists have exploited in the study of subterranean life. Our over-arching goal is to promote caves as model systems where one can perform standardized scientific research. This is important not only to achieve an in-depth understanding of the functioning of subterranean ecosystems but also to fully exploit their long-discussed potential in addressing general scientific questions with implications beyond the boundaries of this discipline.},

By correlating spontaneous activity during ``resting states'' [1], studies of intrinsic brain networks in humans have demonstrated a correspondence with task-related activation patterns [2], relationships to behavior [3], and alterations in processes such as aging [4] and brain disorders [5], highlighting the importance of resting-state measurements for understanding brain function. Here, we develop methods to measure intrinsic functional connectivity in Drosophila, a powerful model for the study of neural computation. Recent studies using calcium imaging have measured neural activity at high spatial and temporal resolution in zebrafish, Drosophila larvae, and worms [6\textendash 10]. For example, calcium imaging in the zebrafish brain recently revealed correlations between the midbrain and hindbrain, demonstrating the utility of measuring intrinsic functional connections in model organisms [8]. An important component of human connectivity research is the use of brain atlases to compare findings across individuals and studies [11]. An anatomical atlas of the central adult fly brain was recently described [12]; however, combining an atlas with whole-brain calcium imaging has yet to be performed in vivo in adult Drosophila. Here, we measure intrinsic functional connectivity in Drosophila by acquiring calcium signals from the central brain. We develop an alignment procedure to assign functional data to atlas regions and correlate activity between regions to generate brain networks. This work reveals a large-scale architecture for neural communication and provides a framework for using Drosophila to study functional brain networks.},

We are less accustomed to think of the roles of charismatic leaders in our scientific communities, as we prefer to believe that we all ``follow the science'' rather than the scientist! Nonetheless, my eyes were opened to the impact of personal charisma in science at the Society for Neuroscience Meeting in 1980. I was chatting with a very fine membrane biophysicist when Eric Kandel walked by and my colleague said, ``Kandel is my hero.'' I was surprised, as the work my friend did was detailed characterization of membrane currents, far from the grand sweep of Kandel's work. And when I asked my friend why he revered Kandel, he said that he didn't dare to dream to big picture questions but restricted himself to elucidating the details of cellular mechanisms precisely because of his own lack of visionary courage. My friend valued Kandel, not for the details of his experiments, but for articulating that someday it would be possible to establish the molecular and cellular bases of learning and memory. I learned from this conversation that scientists add value or are destructive to our collective enterprise in disparate ways. Henry Markram is one of these fascinating individuals who dared to set himself and our community the most ambitious of goals.

In the insect brain, the central complex integrates multiple forms of sensory information and guides locomotion during behaviors such as foraging, climbing over barriers, and navigating to memorized locations. These roles suggest that the central complex influences motor commands, directing the appropriate movement within the current context. Such commands are ultimately carried out by the limbs and must therefore interact with pattern generators and reflex circuits that coordinate them. Recent studies have described how neurons of the central complex encode sensory information: neurons subdivide the space around the animal, encoding the direction or orientation of stimuli used in navigation. Does a similar central-complex code directing movement exist, and if so, how does it effect changes in the control of limbs? Recording from central-complex neurons in freely walking cockroaches (Blaberus discoidalis), we identified classes of movement-predictive cells selective for slow or fast forward walking, left or right turns, or combinations of forward and turning speeds. Stimulation through recording wires produced consistent trajectories of forward walking or turning in these animals, and those that elicited turns also altered an inter-joint reflex to a pattern resembling spontaneous turning. When an animal transitioned to climbing over an obstacle, the encoding of movement in this new context changed for a subset of cells. These results indicate that encoding of movement in the central complex participates in motor control by a distributed, flexible code targeting limb reflex circuits.},

We demonstrate the versatility of this framework by tracking various body parts in multiple species across a broad collection of behaviors.

  abstract = {Deep neural networks are highly effective tools for human and animal pose estimation. However, robustness to out-of-domain data remains a challenge. Here, we probe the transfer and generalization ability for pose estimation with two architecture classes (MobileNetV2s and ResNets) pretrained on ImageNet. We generated a novel dataset of 30 horses that allowed for both within-domain and out-of-domain (unseen horse) testing. We find that pretraining on ImageNet strongly improves out-of-domain performance. Moreover, we show that for both pretrained and networks trained from scratch, better ImageNet-performing architectures perform better for pose estimation, with a substantial improvement on out-of-domain data when pretrained. Collectively, our results demonstrate that transfer learning is particularly beneficial for out-of-domain robustness.}

Field studies in various ecosystems have shown that the intensity of insect herbivory increases when the UV-B spectral band of solar radiation is experimentally attenuated using filters. This effect of UV-B on insect herbivory has been attributed to UV-B-induced changes in the characteristics of plant tissues, and to direct damaging effects of UV-B photons on the animals. We tested for effects of UV-B radiation on insect behaviour using field experiments with the thrips Caliothrips phaseoli. When placed in a `choice' tunnel under natural daylight, these insects showed a clear preference for low-UV-B environments, and this preference could not be accounted for by differences between environments in total irradiance. These results provide the first evidence of ambient UV-B photoperception in an insect, challenging the idea that animals are unable to detect variations in the narrow UV-B component of solar radiation.},

Sleep is controlled by both circadian and homeostatic mechanisms, and environmental factors such as light, temperature, and social stimuli are fundamental in shaping and confining sleep episodes into the correct time of the day. Among environmental cues, light seems to have a prominent function in modulating the timing of sleep during the 24 h and, in this review, we will discuss the role of light inputs in modulating the distribution of the fly sleep-wake cycles. This phenomenon is of growing interest in the modern society, where artificial light exposure during the night is a common trait, opening the possibility to study Drosophila as a model organism for investigating shift-work disorders.},

Here we review recent advances in the understanding of rapid variations in the waking state, how variations are generated, and how they modulate neural and behavioral responses in both mice and humans. We propose that the brain has an identifiable set of states through which it wanders continuously in a nonrandom fashion, owing to the activity of both ascending modulatory and fast-acting corticocortical and subcortical-cortical neural pathways. These state variations provide the backdrop upon which the brain operates, and understanding them is critical to making progress in revealing the neural mechanisms underlying cognition and behavior.},

Recent evidence supports the subdivision of sensorimotor learning into explicit and implicit processes that simultaneously subserve task performance (Taylor et al., 2014). We set out to test whether these two accounts of learning processes are homologous. Using a recently developed method to assay explicit and implicit learning directly in a sensorimotor task, along with a computational modeling analysis, we show that the fast process closely resembles explicit learning and the slow process approximates implicit learning. In addition, we provide evidence for a subdivision of the slow/implicit process into distinct manifestations of motor memory. We conclude that the two-state model of motor learning is a close approximation of sensorimotor learning, but it is unable to describe adequately the various implicit learning operations that forge the learning curve. Our results suggest that a wider net be cast in the search for the putative psychological mechanisms and neural substrates underlying the multiplicity of processes involved in motor learning.},

It is unclear if these brain changes differ with varying mission durations or one's history of spaceflight experience (e.g., number of prior missions, time between missions). Here we addressed this issue by quantifying voxelwise post-flight changes in gray matter volume, white matter microstructure, extracellular free water (FW), and ventricular volume in a sample of 28 astronauts. We found that longer missions induced greater ventricular expansion and larger FW displacement at the top of the brain. A greater number of prior missions was associated with white matter microstructure declines in a tract supporting voluntary leg movement. Longer inter-mission intervals were associated with greater ventricle expansion, with compensatory ventricular expansion observed only in those crewmembers with inter-missions intervals of 3 years or longer. Longer missions therefore induce more extensive brain fluid shifts, and the ventricles may require at least 3 years to recover post-flight.},

It makes a variety of statistical characterisations of trajectories, such as tortuosity, speed and changes in direction, available to biologists who may not have a background in programming. We discuss a range of indices that have been used by researchers, describe the package in detail, then use movement observations of whales and clearwing moths to demonstrate some of the capabilities of trajr. As an open-source R package, trajr encourages open and reproducible research. It supports the implementation of additional methods by providing access to trajectory analysis ``building blocks,'' allows the full suite of R statistical analysis tools to be applied to trajectory analysis, and the source code can be independently validated.},

Recording the electrical activity of different brain areas shows that when the animal is active (awake), slow waves are present only in the central complex.

  abstract = {The structure of sleep across the night as expressed by the hypnogram, is characterised by repeated transitions between the different states of vigilance: wake, light and deep non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. This review is concerned with current knowledge on these state transitions, focusing primarily on those findings that allow the integration of data at cellular level with spectral time-course data at the encephalographic (EEG) level. At the cellular level it has been proposed that, under the influence of circadian and homeostatic factors, transitions between wake and sleep may be determined by mutually inhibitory interaction between sleep-active neurons in the hypothalamic preoptic area and wake-active neurons in multiple arousal centres. These two fundamentally different behavioural states are separated by the sleep onset and the sleep inertia periods each characterised by gradual changes in which neither true wake nor true sleep patterns are present. The results of sequential spectral analysis of EEG data on moves towards and away from deep sleep are related to findings at the cellular level on the generating mechanisms giving rise to the various NREM oscillatory modes under the neuromodulatory control of brainstem-thalamic activating systems. And there is substantial evidence at cellular level that transition to and from REM sleep is governed by the reciprocal interaction between cholinergic REM-on neurons and aminergic REM-off neurons located in the brainstem. Similarity between the time-course of the REM-on neuronal activity and that of EEG power in the high beta range ({$\sim$}18-30 Hz) allows a tentative parallelism to be drawn between the two. This review emphasises the importance of the thalamically projecting brainstem activating systems in the orchestration of the transitions that give rise to state progression across the sleep-wake cycle. \textcopyright{} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Ants are famous in the animal kingdom for their amazing load-carrying performance. Yet, the mechanisms that allow these insects to maintain their stability when carrying heavy loads have been poorly investigated. Here, we present a study of the kinematics of unloaded and loaded locomotion in the polymorphic seed-harvesting ant Messor barbarus. In this species, large ants have larger heads relative to their size than small ants. Hence, their center of mass is shifted forward, and even more so when they are carrying a load in their mandibles. We tested the hypothesis that this could lead to large ants being less statically stable than small ants, thus explaining their lower load-carrying ability. We found that large ants were indeed less statically stable than small ants when walking unloaded, but they were nonetheless able to adjust their stepping pattern to partly compensate for this instability. When ants were walking loaded on the other hand, there was no evidence of different locomotor behaviors in individuals of different sizes. Loaded ants, whatever their size, move too slowly to maintain their balance through dynamic stability. Rather, they seem to do so by clinging to the ground with their hind legs during part of a stride. We show through a straightforward model that allometric relationships have a minor role in explaining the differences in load-carrying ability between large ants and small ants, and that a simple scale effect is sufficient to explain these differences.},

  abstract = {Understanding of biomechanical factors in sprint running is useful because of their critical value to performance. Some variables measured in distance running are also important in sprint running. Significant factors include: reaction time, technique, electromyographic (EMG) activity, force production, neural factors and muscle structure. Although various methodologies have been used, results are clear and conclusions can be made. The reaction time of good athletes is short, but it does not correlate with performance levels. Sprint technique has been well analysed during acceleration, constant velocity and deceleration of the velocity curve. At the beginning of the sprint run, it is important to produce great force/ power and generate high velocity in the block and acceleration phases. During the constant-speed phase, the events immediately before and during the braking phase are important in increasing explosive force/power and efficiency of movement in the propulsion phase. There are no research results available regarding force production in the sprint-deceleration phase. The EMG activity pattern of the main sprint muscles is described in the literature, but there is a need for research with highly skilled sprinters to better understand the simultaneous operation of many muscles. Skeletal muscle fibre characteristics are related to the selection of talent and the training-induced effects in sprint running. Efficient sprint running requires an optimal combination between the examined biomechanical variables and external factors such as footwear, ground and air resistance. Further research work is needed especially in the area of nervous system, muscles and force and power production during sprint running. Combining these with the measurements of sprinting economy and efficiency more knowledge can be achieved in the near future. \textcopyright{} 1992, Adis International Limited. All rights reserved.},

One species, Arachnocampa flava, is known to possess true circadian regulation of bioluminescence: light:dark cycles entrain the rhythm of nocturnal glowing. Given the absence of natural light as a cue in caves, we addressed the question of whether cave populations of Arachnocampa tasmaniensis, a species known to inhabit caves as well as epigean environments, are rhythmic. We found that the major dark-zone cave populations of A. tasmaniensis maintain a high-amplitude 24-hour rhythm of bioluminescence, with the acrophase during external daylight hours. Populations of A. tasmaniensis in caves many kilometers apart show similar, but not exactly the same, timing of the acrophase. Systematic investigation of colonies in the dark zone of a single cave showed that some smaller colonies distant to the main ceiling colony, also in the dark zone, glow in antiphase. Periodic monitoring of a single colony over several years showed that the acrophase shifted from nocturnal to diurnal some time between October 2008 and January 2009. Prey availability was investigated as a possible zeitgeber. The acrophase of prey availability, as measured by light trapping, and the acrophase of bioluminescence do not precisely match, occurring 3 hours apart. Using in-cave artificial light exposure, we show that after LD cycles, cave larvae become entrained to bioluminesce during the foregoing photophase. In contrast, epigean larvae exposed to artificial LD cycles after a period of DD become entrained to bioluminesce during the foregoing scotophase. One explanation is that individuals within colonies in the dark zone synchronize their bioluminescence rhythms through detection and matching of each other 's bioluminescence.},

Network analyses of more than 9 million interactions revealed three distinct groups that differ in behavioral repertoires. Each group represents a functional behavioral unit with workers moving from one group to the next as they age. The rate of interactions was much higher within groups than between groups. The precise information on spatial and temporal distribution of all individuals allowed us to calculate the expected rates of within- and between-group interactions. These values suggest that the network of interaction within colonies is primarily mediated by age-induced changes in the spatial location of workers.}

  abstract = {\textcopyright{} 2014 Mertes, Dittmar, Egelhaaf and Boeddeker. Bees use visual memories to find the spatial location of previously learnt food sites. Characteristic learning flights help acquiring these memories at newly discovered foraging locations where landmarks\textemdash salient objects in the vicinity of the goal location\textemdash can play an important role in guiding the animal's homing behavior. Although behavioral experiments have shown that bees can use a variety of visual cues to distinguish objects as landmarks, the question of how landmark features are encoded by the visual system is still open. Recently, it could be shown that motion cues are sufficient to allow bees localizing their goal using landmarks that can hardly be discriminated from the background texture. Here, we tested the hypothesis that motion sensitive neurons in the bee's visual pathway provide information about such landmarks during a learning flight and might, thus, play a role for goal localization. We tracked learning flights of free-flying bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) in an arena with distinct visual landmarks, reconstructed the visual input during these flights, and replayed ego-perspective movies to tethered bumblebees while recording the activity of direction-selective wide-field neurons in their optic lobe. By comparing neuronal responses during a typical learning flight and targeted modifications of landmark properties in this movie we demonstrate that these objects are indeed represented in the bee's visual motion pathway. We find that object-induced responses vary little with object texture, which is in agreement with behavioral evidence. These neurons thus convey information about landmark properties that are useful for view-based homing.},

  abstract = {Trophallaxis is a complex social fluid exchange emblematic of social insects and of ants in particular. Trophallaxis behaviors are present in approximately half of all ant genera, distributed over 11 subfamilies. Across biological life, intra- and inter-species exchanged fluids tend to occur in only the most fitness-relevant behavioral contexts, typically transmitting endogenously produced molecules adapted to exert influence on the receiver's physiology or behavior. Despite this, many aspects of trophallaxis remain poorly understood, such as the prevalence of the different forms of trophallaxis, the components transmitted, their roles in colony physiology and how these behaviors have evolved. With this review, we define the forms of trophallaxis observed in ants and bring together current knowledge on the mechanics of trophallaxis, the contents of the fluids transmitted, the contexts in which trophallaxis occurs and the roles these behaviors play in colony life. We identify six contexts where trophallaxis occurs: nourishment, short- and long-term decision making, immune defense, social maintenance, aggression, and inoculation and maintenance of the gut microbiota. Though many ideas have been put forth on the evolution of trophallaxis, our analyses support the idea that stomodeal trophallaxis has become a fixed aspect of colony life primarily in species that drink liquid food and, further, that the adoption of this behavior was key for some lineages in establishing ecological dominance. Trophallaxis plays a vital role in colony physiology, nutrient distribution, and communication, and doing so underscores the necessity of understanding this complicated suite of behaviors in all of its manifestations.Open access, licensed under CC BY 4.0. \textcopyright{} 2020 The Author(s).DOI: 10.25849/myrmecol.news\_031:001  Pages: 1-30 Volume: 31 Year: 2021 Journal: Myrmecol.

  abstract = {Effects of food supply on daily periodic locomotor activity in the ground beetle Carabus auronitens were recorded in the laboratory with the animals exposed to natural daylight and photoperiod. Inspection of individual actograms exhibits that in most cases feeding leads to strongly reduced and more or less irregularly distributed activity for a period of up to 4 days. In terms of quantitative parameters, the animals respond to food supply by an immediate reduction of mean amounts of daily activity. This is achieved through the reduction of duration (as a consequence of reduced burstlengths instead of burstnumber) and, less distinctly, the reduction of intensity. The initial levels of parameters are reattained after 4 days. Direct comparison by means of standardized (i.e. level-independent) relative parameter functions demonstrates close concordance between the amount and duration of daily activity; however, distinct synchronous change of intensity is apparent as a consequence of food supply only. This means that any variation of activity amounts is due to changing duration rather than to intensity variation. In analogy to the feeding-dependent parameter dynamics, also the proportion of animals with strong synchronization to the natural light/dark cycle is considerably reduced by food supply. The feeding-dependent reduction of activity is paralleled by temporarily reduced activity of proteolytic enzymes in the beetles. It is argued that, for the purpose of energy saving, the animals will remain inactive as long as reduced enzyme activity inhibits further consumption and digestion of food.},

Most actograms exhibit directed seasonal variations of duration and phase position of daily activity. Seasonal locomotor activity starts in early spring (following dormancy) on a low daily level, first being confined to a short time span around dusk (and even shorter around dawn). In the course of season, the daily onsets of activity become closely related with sunset and the duration of daily activity is steadily extended with both parts of the bimodal phase fusing to a common, unimodal activity band by late spring. Subsequently, it is further extended into forenoon, until in summer (shortly before aestivation), spontaneous phase inversion turns activity periodicity from nocturnality into diurnality within 1 day. Such seasonal variations are paralleled by changes in the precision of synchronization of the individuals' activity rhythms to the entraining light/dark cycle. No geographical differences were detected. The results support the idea of the circadian clock as a system of two dynamically coupled physiological oscillators that invert their phase relation as soon as the natural dark phase falls short of some minimum-tolerable night length.},

The first four species have typical `slow-eyed', monophasic ERG responses; the two flies typical `fast-eyed', biphasic responses. The FFF proved to be dependent on the state of light adaptation, being 40\textendash 70\% higher than the above figures after only 2 min exposure to as little as 300 lx. Adult male Glossina, but not Locusta nymphs, showed a clear 100 Hz ERG ripple in response to single-phase, mains fluorescent lighting. To three-phase fluorescent lighting no 300 Hz ERG ripple was detected, but the 100 Hz component was still evident.},

Its purposes were (a) to determine selected kinematic data for a world record triple jump, and (b) to compare these data with corresponding data for previous performances by the same athlete and for performances by other elite triple jumpers. A comparison of the phase distances and phase ratios for the 1985 TAC jumps with those for the best analyzed jump by Banks, Conley, and Joyner at some previous meets revealed that, as they increased their effective distances, all three decreased the emphasis they placed on the step phase. The best athletes seem to use a ``pawing'' (or active) landing prior to takeoff into the step phase and a ``blocking'' landing prior to takeoff into the jump phase.}

  abstract = {Quantifying individual variation in labile physiological or behavioral traits often involves repeated measures through time, so as to test for consistency of individual differences (often using repeatability, ``R'') and/or individual differences in trendlines over time. Another form of temporal change in behavior is temporal autocorrelation, which predicts observations taken closely together in time to be correlated, leading to nonrandom residuals about individual temporal trendlines. Temporal autocorrelation may result from slowly changing internal states (e.g., hormone or energy levels), leading to slowly changing behavior. Autocorrelation is a well-known phenomenon, but has been largely neglected by those studying individual variation in behavior. Here, we provide two worked examples which show substantial temporal autocorrelation (r \&gt; 0.4) is present in spontaneous activity rates of guppies (Poecilia reticulata) and house mice (Mus domesticus) in stable laboratory conditions, even after accounting for temporal plasticity of individuals. Second, we show that ignoring autocorrelation does bias estimates of R and temporal reaction norm variances upwards, both in our worked examples and in separate simulations. This bias occurs due to the misestimation of individual-specific means and slopes. Given the increasing use of technologies that generate behavioral and physiological data at high sampling rates, we can now study among- and within-individual changes in behavior in more detailed ways, including autocorrelation, which we discuss from biological and methodological perspectives and provide recommendations and annotated R code to help researchers implement these models on their data.Behavioral traits require repeated observations in order to quantify individual differences in behavior (``personality'') and changes in behavior in response to environmental conditions or time (``plasticity''). However, when observations are taken closely together in time, observations are likely to be taken under similar internal states, leading to temporal autocorrelation. While this is a well-known phenomenon in many fields, it has been largely ignored in behavioral ecology. Here, we demonstrate in two model organisms that observations separated by a day are substantially correlated. Through simulations, we then demonstrate how this affects the analysis of personality and plasticity studies. We then discuss the biological and methodological implications of this autocorrelation.},

  abstract = {The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster shows a bimodal circadian locomotor rhythm with peaks at lights-on and before lights-off, which are regulated by multiple clocks in the brain. Even under light-dark cycles, the timing of the evening peak is highly dependent on temperature, starting earlier under lower ambient temperature but terminating almost at the same time. In the present study, using behavioral and immunohistochemical assays, the authors show that separate groups of clock neurons, either light-entrainable or temperature-entrainable, form a functional system driving the locomotor rhythm. When subjected to a light cycle combined with a temperature cycle advanced by 6 h relative to the light cycle, the dorsally located neurons (DNs) and lateral posterior neurons (LPNs) shifted their phase of TIMELESS expression, but the laterally located protocerebral neurons (LNs) basically maintained their original phase. Thus, the LNs seem to be preferentially light-entrainable and the DNs and LPNs to be primarily temperature-entrainable. In pdf(01) mutant flies that lack the neuropeptide PDF in the ventral groups of LNs, the onset of the evening peak was greatly advanced even under synchronized light and temperature cycles and was shifted even more than in wild-type flies in response to a 6-h phase shift of the temperature cycle, suggesting that ventral LNs have a strong impact on the phase of the other cells. It seems likely that the 2 sets of clock cells with different entrainability to light and temperature, and the coupling between them, enable Drosophila to keep a proper phase relationship of circadian activity with respect to the daily light and temperature cycles.},

From an evolutionary point of view, almost all animal species that have been investigated exhibit sleep or sleep-like states, suggesting that sleep may benefit survival. In certain mammalian and avian species, sleep can be further divided into at least two stages, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-REM sleep. In addition to a widely conserved role for sleep, these individual sleep stages may have roles unique to these animals. The recent use of state-of-the-art techniques, including optogenetics and chemogenetics, has greatly broadened our understanding of the neural mechanisms of sleep regulation, allowing us to address the function of sleep. Studies focusing on non-mammalian animals species have also provided novel insights into the evolution of sleep.

In the cockroach Periplaneta americana, thermoreceptor neurons on antennae and thermosensory interneurons in the antennal lobe have been characterized electrophysiologically, and recent studies using advanced transgenic technologies in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster have added much to the knowledge of these neurons, enabling us to discuss common principles of thermosensory processing systems in insects. Cockroaches and many other insects possess only one type of thermoreceptor neurons on antennae that are excited by cooling and inhibited by warming. In contrast, the antennae of fruit flies and other dipterans possess oppositely responding warm and cold receptor neurons. Despite differences in their thermoreceptive equipment, central processing of temperature information is much the same in flies and cockroaches. Axons of thermoreceptor neurons project to the margin of the antennal lobe and form glomeruli, from which cold, warm and cold-warm projection neurons originate, the last neurons being excited by both cooling and warming. Axons of antennal lobe thermosensory projection neurons of the antennal lobe terminate in three distinct areas of the protocerebrum, the mushroom body, lateral horn and posterior lateral protocerebrum, the last area also receiving termination of hygrosensory projection neurons. Such multiple thermosensory pathways may serve to control multiple forms of thermosensory behavior. Electrophysiological studies on cockroaches and transgenic approaches in flies are encouraged to complement each other for further elucidating general principles of thermosensory processing in the insect brain.},

The sample was diverse in terms of social class, income level, health status and type of work exit.

However, the degree of choice and control around the transition to retirement was highly variable and socially structured. The notion of planning was embedded as a normative practice, particularly in relation to finances, but the practice of planning was highly contingent primarily due to personal circumstances (ill-health, bereavement, relationships) and work exit (redundancy, work stress, changes to shift patterns or hours). The findings offer insights into the reasons why many people do not plan and indicate that many of the assumptions associated with retirement planning warrant further consideration both theoretically and practically.},

Further support for this hypothesis was provided by LD 1:23 experiments, in which entrainment occurred when the light pulse was situated at the end, but not at the beginning, of the subjective photophase. Steady-state entrainment of the locomotor rhythm was achieved with square-wave temperature cycles of 10oC amplitude under constant dark: most of the activity occurred within the early thermophase. Smaller amplitude temperature cycles yielded relative coordination of the rhythm. Interactions of temperature and light-dark cycles resulted in entrainment patterns different from those elicited in response to either cycle alone or those formed by a simple combination of the two separate responses. Furthermore, temperature cycles having amplitudes insufficient for entrainment of the rhythm nevertheless modified the pattern of entrainment to light - dark cycles, suggesting a synergism of light and temperature effects on the underlying circadian clock system.},

To this end, we have developed a novel vision-based tracking system, FicTrac (Fictive path Tracking software), for estimating the path an animal makes whilst rotating an air-supported sphere using only input from a standard camera and computer vision techniques. We have found that the accuracy and robustness of FicTrac outperforms a low-cost implementation of a standard optical mouse-based approach for generating fictive paths. FicTrac is simple to implement for a wide variety of experimental configurations and, importantly, is fast to execute, enabling real-time sensory feedback for behaving animals. We have used FicTrac to record the behaviour of tethered honeybees, Apis mellifera, whilst presenting visual stimuli in both open-loop and closed-loop experimental paradigms.

Using FicTrac, we have demonstrated closed-loop visual fixation in both the honeybee and the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, establishing the flexibility of this system.

We measured the metabolic rate of Pach\'on cave and surface fish at a fixed swimming speed under light/dark and constant dark photoperiods. In constant darkness surface forms exhibited a circadian rhythm in metabolism with an increase in oxygen demand during the subjective daytime, whereas cave forms did not. The lack of circadian rhythm in metabolism leads to a 27\% energy savings for Pach\'on cave fish compared to surface fish when comparing both forms in their natural photoperiods. When surface forms were tested under constant dark conditions they expended 38\% more energy than cave forms under equivalent conditions. Elimination of the circadian rhythm in metabolism may be a general feature of animals that live in perpetually dark food-limited environments such as caves or the deep sea.},

There are several kinds of interval estimates, but the most popular are confidence intervals (CIs): intervals that contain the true parameter value in some known proportion of repeated samples, on average. The width of confidence intervals is thought to index the precision of an estimate; CIs are thought to be a guide to which parameter values are plausible or reasonable; and the confidence coefficient of the interval (e.g., 95 \%) is thought to index the plausibility that the true parameter is included in the interval. We show in a number of examples that CIs do not necessarily have any of these properties, and can lead to unjustified or arbitrary inferences. For this reason, we caution against relying upon confidence interval theory to justify interval estimates, and suggest that other theories of interval estimation should be used instead.},

An index of the force application technique was computed as the slope of the linear relationship between the decrease in the ratio of horizontal-to-resultant GRF and the increase in velocity. Mechanical power output was positively correlated to mean 100-m speed (P{$<$}0.01), as was the theoretical maximal velocity production capability (P{$<$}0.011), whereas the theoretical maximal force production capability was not. The ability to apply the resultant force backward during acceleration was positively correlated to 100-m performance (rs[0.683; P{$<$}0.018), but the magnitude of resultant force was not (P = 0.16). Step frequency, contact and swing time were significantly correlated to acceleration and 100-m performance (positively for the former, negatively for the two latter, all P{$<$}0.05), whereas aerial time and step length were not (all P[0.21). Last, anthropometric data of body mass index and lowerlimb- to-height ratio showed no significant correlation with 100-m performance. We concluded that the main mechanical determinants of 100-m performance were (1) a "velocity-oriented" force-velocity profile, likely explained by (2) a higher ability to apply the resultant GRF vector with a forward orientation over the acceleration, and (3) a higher step frequency resulting from a shorter contact time. \textcopyright{} Springer-Verlag 2012.},

We recorded from dopamine neurons in monkeys engaged in two types of trial: reference trials in an instructed-choice task and decision trials in a two-armed bandit decision task. We show that the activity of dopamine neurons in the decision setting is modulated according to the value of the upcoming action. Moreover, analysis of the probability matching strategy in the decision trials revealed that the dopamine population activity and not the reward during reference trials determines choice behavior. Because dopamine neurons do not have spatial or motor properties, we conclude that immediate decisions are likely to be generated elsewhere and conveyed to the dopamine neurons, which play a role in shaping long-term decision policy through dynamic modulation of the efficacy of basal ganglia synapses.},

Because these cell types have some of the most conspicuous behavioral correlates among neurons in nonsensory cortical systems, and because their spatial firing structure reflects computations internally in the system, studies of entorhinal-hippocampal representations may offer considerable insight into general principles of cortical network dynamics.},

For instance, they are unimodal exponential families of densities in the response variable with tail behavior determined by the implicit mean-variance relationship. Dirichlet process (DP) mixing adds considerable flexibility to these models. Using such mixing, we develop models that we call DPMGLM's, which still retain the GLM character with regard to the mean. Overdispersed GLM's (OGLM's) provide an alternative class of models to cope with extra variability in samples. We show that how OGLM's may be DP mixed, leading to what we call DPMOGLM's. These models are extremely rich. Moreover, recent computational advances enable them to be fitted straightforwardly. We illustrate this with both simulated and real datasets. We also address the question of choosing between the GLM, OGLM, DPMGLM, and DPMOGLM. Finally, we consider extensions, by DP mixing, of hierarchical or multistage GLM's.},

Since the early 2000s biologists have been using Virtual Environments (VE) to investigate the mechanisms of behavior in non-human animals including insects, fish, and mammals. VEs have become reliable tools for studying vision, cognition, and sensory-motor control in animals. In turn, the knowledge gained from studying such behaviors can be harnessed by researchers designing biologically inspired robots, smart sensors, and multi-agent artificial intelligence. VE for animals is becoming a widely used application of XR technology but such applications have not previously been reported in the technical literature related to XR. Biologists and computer scientists can benefit greatly from deepening interdisciplinary research in this emerging field and together we can develop new methods for conducting fundamental research in behavioral sciences and engineering. To support our argument we present this review which provides an overview of animal behavior experiments conducted in virtual environments.},

  abstract = {Repeatability (more precisely the common measure of repeatability, the intra-class correlation coefficient, ICC) is an important index for quantifying the accuracy of measurements and the constancy of phenotypes. It is the proportion of phenotypic variation that can be attributed to between-subject (or between-group) variation. As a consequence, the non-repeatable fraction of phenotypic variation is the sum of measurement error and phenotypic flexibility. There are several ways to estimate repeatability for Gaussian data, but there are no formal agreements on how repeatability should be calculated for non-Gaussian data (e.g. binary, proportion and count data). In addition to point estimates, appropriate uncertainty estimates (standard errors and confidence intervals) and statistical significance for repeatability estimates are required regardless of the types of data. We review the methods for calculating repeatability and the associated statistics for Gaussian and non-Gaussian data. For Gaussian data, we present three common approaches for estimating repeatability: correlation-based, analysis of variance (ANOVA)-based and linear mixed-effects model (LMM)-based methods, while for non-Gaussian data, we focus on generalised linear mixed-effects models (GLMM) that allow the estimation of repeatability on the original and on the underlying latent scale. We also address a number of methods for calculating standard errors, confidence intervals and statistical significance; the most accurate and recommended methods are parametric bootstrapping, randomisation tests and Bayesian approaches. We advocate the use of LMM- and GLMM-based approaches mainly because of the ease with which confounding variables can be controlled for. Furthermore, we compare two types of repeatability (ordinary repeatability and extrapolated repeatability) in relation to narrow-sense heritability. This review serves as a collection of guidelines and recommendations for biologists to calculate repeatability and heritability from both Gaussian and non-Gaussian data.},

However, estimating R2 for generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) remains challenging. We have previously introduced a version of R2 that we called  for Poisson and binomial GLMMs, but not for other distributional families. Similarly, we earlier discussed how to estimate intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) using Poisson and binomial GLMMs. In this paper, we generalize our methods to all other non-Gaussian distributions, in particular to negative binomial and gamma distributions that are commonly used for modelling biological data. While expanding our approach, we highlight two useful concepts for biologists, Jensen's inequality and the delta method, both of which help us in understanding the properties of GLMMs. Jensen's inequality has important implications for biologically meaningful interpretation of GLMMs, whereas the delta method allows a general derivation of variance associated with non-Gaussian distributions. We also discuss some special considerations for binomial GLMMs with binary or proportion data. We illustrate the implementation of our extension by worked examples from the field of ecology and evolution in the R environment. However, our method can be used across disciplines and regardless of statistical environments.},

This study aims to develop a 3D markerless motion capture technique, using OpenPose with multiple synchronized video cameras, and examine its accuracy in comparison with optical marker-based motion capture. Participants performed three motor tasks (walking, countermovement jumping, and ball throwing), with these movements measured using both marker-based optical motion capture and OpenPose-based markerless motion capture. The differences in corresponding joint positions, estimated from the two different methods throughout the analysis, were presented as a mean absolute error (MAE). The results demonstrated that, qualitatively, 3D pose estimation using markerless motion capture could correctly reproduce the movements of participants. Quantitatively, of all the mean absolute errors calculated, approximately 47\% were less than 20 mm and 80\% were less than 30 mm. However, 10\% were greater than 40 mm. The primary reason for mean absolute errors exceeding 40mm was that OpenPose failed to track the participant's pose in 2D images owing to failures, such as recognition of an object as a human body segment, or replacing one segment with another depending on the image of each frame. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that, if an algorithm that corrects all apparently wrong tracking can be incorporated into the system, OpenPose-based markerless motion capture can be used for human movement science with an accuracy of 30mm or less.},

In habitats where landmark information is sparse, homing ants travel their entire home vector before searching systematically with ever increasing loops. Search strategies have not been previously investigated in ants that inhabit landmark-rich habitats where they typically establish stereotypical routes. Here we examine the search strategy in one such ant, Melophorus bagoti, by confining their foraging in one-dimensional channels to determine if their search pattern changes with experience, location of distant cues and altered distance on the homebound journey. Irrespective of conditions, we found ants exhibit a progressive search that drifted towards the fictive nest and beyond. Segments moving away from the start of the homeward journey were longer than segments heading back towards the start. The right tail distribution of segment lengths was well fitted by a power function, but slopes less than -3 on a log-log plot indicate that the process cannot be characterized as L\'evy searches that have optimal slopes near -2. A double exponential function fits the distribution of segment lengths better, supporting another theoretically optimal search pattern, the composite Brownian walk. \textcopyright{} 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

To investigate the underlying neuronal correlates of natural behavior, it is useful to have access to state-of-the-art recording equipment (e.g., 2-photon imaging, patch recordings, etc.) that frequently requires head fixation. This limitation has been addressed with various approaches such as virtual reality/air ball or treadmill systems. However, achieving multimodal realistic behavior in these systems can be challenging. These systems are often also complex and expensive to implement. Here we present ``Air-Track,'' an easy-to-build head-fixed behavioral environment that requires only minimal computational processing. The Air-Track is a lightweight physical maze floating on an air table that has all the properties of the ``real'' world, including multiple sensory modalities tightly coupled to motor actions. To test this system, we trained mice in Go/No-Go and two-alternative forced choice tasks in a plus maze. Mice chose lanes and discriminated apertures or textures by moving the Air-Track back and forth and rotating it around themselves. Mice rapidly adapted to moving the track and used visual, auditory, and tactile cues to guide them in performing the tasks. A custom-controlled camera system monitored animal location and generated data that could be used to calculate reaction times in the visual and somatosensory discrimination tasks. We conclude that the Air-Track system is ideal for eliciting natural behavior in concert with virtually any system for monitoring or manipulating brain activity.},

  abstract = {Do all animals sleep? Sleep has been observed in many vertebrates, and there is a growing body of evidence for sleep-like states in arthropods and nematodes [1\textendash 5]. Here we show that sleep is also present in Cnidaria [6\textendash 8], an earlier-branching metazoan lineage. Cnidaria and Ctenophora are the first metazoan phyla to evolve tissue-level organization and differentiated cell types, such as neurons and muscle [9\textendash 15]. In Cnidaria, neurons are organized into a non-centralized radially symmetric nerve net [11, 13, 15\textendash 17] that nevertheless shares fundamental properties with the vertebrate nervous system: action potentials, synaptic transmission, neuropeptides, and neurotransmitters [15\textendash 20]. It was reported that cnidarian soft corals [21] and box jellyfish [22, 23] exhibit periods of quiescence, a pre-requisite for sleep-like states, prompting us to ask whether sleep is present in Cnidaria. Within Cnidaria, the upside-down jellyfish Cassiopea spp. displays a quantifiable pulsing behavior, allowing us to perform long-term behavioral tracking. Monitoring of Cassiopea pulsing activity for consecutive days and nights revealed behavioral quiescence at night that is rapidly reversible, as well as a delayed response to stimulation in the quiescent state. When deprived of nighttime quiescence, Cassiopea exhibited decreased activity and reduced responsiveness to a sensory stimulus during the subsequent day, consistent with homeostatic regulation of the quiescent state. Together, these results indicate that Cassiopea has a sleep-like state, supporting the hypothesis that sleep arose early in the metazoan lineage, prior to the emergence of a centralized nervous system. Understanding the phylogenetic roots of behaviors sheds light on the evolutionary forces that shape them. Sleep has been observed in worms, flies, zebrafish, and mice. Nath et al. discover that jellyfish have a sleep-like state. This shifts the known root of sleep in the phylogenetic tree prior to the emergence of a centralized nervous system.},

  abstract = {Noninvasive behavioral tracking of animals during experiments is critical to many scientific pursuits. Extracting the poses of animals without using markers is often essential to measuring behavioral effects in biomechanics, genetics, ethology, and neuroscience. However, extracting detailed poses without markers in dynamically changing backgrounds has been challenging. We recently introduced an open-source toolbox called DeepLabCut that builds on a state-of-the-art human pose-estimation algorithm to allow a user to train a deep neural network with limited training data to precisely track user-defined features that match human labeling accuracy. Here, we provide an updated toolbox, developed as a Python package, that includes new features such as graphical user interfaces (GUIs), performance improvements, and active-learning-based network refinement. We provide a step-by-step procedure for using DeepLabCut that guides the user in creating a tailored, reusable analysis pipeline with a graphical processing unit (GPU) in 1\textendash 12 h (depending on frame size). Additionally, we provide Docker environments and Jupyter Notebooks that can be run on cloud resources such as Google Colaboratory.},

This study was designed to assess changes in central nervous system functioning induced by ultraviolet radiation (active UVR) vs. sham UVR (UVR filtered) in subjects who met criteria consistent with an addictive tanning disorder. Methods: Seven [4 women; 30.7{$\pm$}9.0 years old (mean{$\pm$}SD)] indoor tanners were studied. Subjects were placed under a UVA/UVB emitting tanning light during two sessions. Two visually identical plastic/acrylic filters were placed over the tanning light. Filters were transparent to visible/infrared light and heat; one blocked UVR and one did not. Session order was randomized and subjects were blinded to study order. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) during active and sham UVR sessions was assessed using single photon emission tomography (SPECT). The radioligand was administered immediately upon activation of the tanning light. Results: SPECT imaging revealed increased (p{$<$}0.01) rCBF in the dorsal striatum, including both the caudate and putamen, during active UVR exposure compared to sham UVR. When exposed to active UVR, relative to sham UVR, subjects reported a decrease in desire to tan (p{$<$}0.002). Of the six subjects expressing a preference for a tanning bed, five chose the active UVR condition. Discussion: These preliminary findings offer a novel methodology to assess the neural response to rewarding stimuli and suggest that UVR may have centrally rewarding properties that encourage excessive tanning.},

In order to make heat treatments effective against these pests, the effects of high temperatures on insect physiology must be understood. Insects, being poikilothermic, are particularly sensitive to heat. Nearly every system studied in insects has demonstrated sensitivity to heat. Studies on the effects of heat in insect metabolism demonstrate some adaptability to thermally challenging environments. Respiration, as to be expected, is also effected by heat, and as the body temperature of the insect increases, there are concomitant increases in both metabolism and respiration up to a critical thermal limit. The effects of heat on the nervous and endocrine systems is another area where elevated temperatures wreck havoc. Changes in behavior and development have been documented as resulting from heat treatments. Among the most studied responses of insects to heat is the elicitation of heat shock proteins. The impact of these proteins on thermotolerance are still being investigated. Models of thermal damage leading to the death of the insect are discussed as well as current studies in describing the events of thermal death.},

To investigate how interactions between stressors influence thermal tolerance in the common forest ant, Aphaenogaster picea, we compared the thermal resistance of workers to heat shock with and without pre-exposure to desiccation or starvation stress. Knockdown (KD) time at 40.5 \textdegree C of desiccated ants was reduced 6\% compared to controls, although longer exposure to desiccation did not further reduce thermal tolerance. Starvation, in contrast, had an increasingly severe effect on thermal tolerance: at 21 days, average KD time of starved ants was reduced by 65\% compared to controls. To test whether reduction in thermal tolerance results from impairment of the heat-shock response, we measured basal gene expression and transcriptional induction of two heat-shock proteins (hsp70 and hsp40) in treated and control ants. We found no evidence that either stressor impaired the Hsp response: both desiccation and starvation slightly increased basal Hsp expression under severe stress conditions and did not affect the magnitude of induction under heat shock. These results suggest that the co-occurrence of multiple environmental stressors predicted by climate change models may make populations more vulnerable to future warming than is suggested by the results of single-factor heating experiments.},

However, neurons that regulate the sleep homeostat remain poorly understood. Using neurogenetic approaches combined with Ca2+ imaging, we characterized synaptic connections between dFB neurons and distinct sets of upstream sleep-regulatory neurons. One group of the sleep-promoting upstream neurons is a set of circadian pacemaker neurons that activates dFB neurons via direct glutaminergic excitatory synaptic connections. Opposing this population, a group of arousal-promoting neurons downregulates dFB axonal output with dopamine. Co-activating these two inputs leads to frequent shifts between sleep and wake states. We also show that dFB neurons release the neurotransmitter GABA and inhibit octopaminergic arousal neurons. We propose that dFB neurons integrate synaptic inputs from distinct sets of upstream sleep-promoting circadian clock neurons, and arousal neurons.},

Rodents can navigate a virtual environment by running on a spherical treadmill, but simulating locomotion in this way can both bias and suppress the frequency of their behaviors as well as introduce vestibulo- motor and vestibulovisual sensory conflict during locomotion. Updating the vir- tual environment via the subject's own freely-moving head movements solves both the naturalistic behavior bias and vestibular conflict issues. In this thesis, I review elements of self-motion and 3D scene perception that contribute to a sense of im- mersion in virtual environments and suggest a freely-moving CAVE system as a VR solution for low-artifact neuroscience experiments. The manuscripts describing the 3D graphics Python package and the virtual reality setup are included. In this freely- moving CAVE VR setup, freely-moving rats demonstrate immersion in virtual en- vironments by displaying height aversion to virtual cliffs, exploration preference of virtual objects, and spontaneously modify their locomotion trajectories near virtual walls. These experiments help bridge the classic behavior and virtual reality litera- ture by showing that rats display similar behaviors to virtual environment features without training.},

Only a few specific neurons are exempt from this effect. In the absence of external arousing cues, this quiescent brain state arises by the convergence of neuronal activities toward a fixed-point attractor embedded in an otherwise dynamic neural state space. We observed efficient spontaneous and sensory-evoked exits from quiescence. Our data support the hypothesis that during global states such as sleep, neuronal networks are drawn to a baseline mode and can be effectively reactivated by signaling from arousing circuits.},

  abstract = {Repeatability represents a key parameter in ecological and evolutionary research. Repeatability is underpinned by developmental plasticity and genetic variation but may become biased upwards by repeatable differences in environments to which individuals respond plastically. The extent of upward bias caused by the latter mechanism (causing ``pseudo-repeatability'') is important yet rarely investigated in ecological research. We repeatedly assayed a key behaviour (flight initiation distance) affecting longevity in a wild cricket population (Gryllus campestris). We used naturally moving, translocated and forced-stationary individuals to study bias in repeatability caused by spatial variability in environmental conditions. Our experiments acknowledged that translocations might themselves bias repeatability estimates if animals respond to handling procedures (a necessary component of translocations). Individuals were, therefore, either (i) repeatedly translocated and assayed or (ii) assayed at multiple burrows as part of natural movements. This enabled estimation of behavioural variance attributable to individual, burrow and residual components within each treatment; comparison across treatments addressed whether translocations caused bias. We also calculated repeatability for individuals that were forced to be stationary to investigate whether this led to upward bias of repeatability. For adult crickets, individual explained 17.8\% versus 17.2\%, and burrow 8.7\% versus 10.3\%, of the behavioural variance in translocated versus natural-movement treatments. Repeatability for forced-stationary adults was 31.1\%, thereby demonstrating experimentally that certain study designs bias repeatability upwards. For translocated juveniles, individual explained 10.0\% and burrow 6.0\% of the variance, while in the natural-movement treatment, those components could not be separated as juveniles do not switch burrows. Translocations did not lead to detectable biases in behavioural mean or variance. Repeatability was not biased for adults subjected to the natural-movement treatment because individuals were assayed under many different environments, facilitating the separation of individual from burrow effects. Upward bias would have occurred with less optimal sampling schemes: if individuals had been assayed repeatedly at the same burrow. We, therefore, recommend that translocation experiments are more commonly applied, particularly in stationary species, to ensure the unbiased estimation of repeatability.},

We assumed that the energetic cost during locomotion is given by the sum of positive mechanical work and the heat energy loss that is proportional to the square of joint torque and examined the optimal locomotor pattern based on the energetic cost in a simple dynamical model of a hexapod by computer simulations. The obtained results well agree with characteristics in the locomotor patterns in legged animals; for example, the leg protraction time, step length, and the metabolic cost of transport are almost constant for many velocities, the leg cycling period decreases with velocity, and the energetic cost of locomotion induced by carrying loads linearly increases with mass loaded. This correspondence of the results of calculation to experimental results suggest that the heat energy loss for torque generation is proportional to the square of the torque during locomotion, and that the locomotor pattern in legged animals is highly optimized based on the energetic cost.}

One type of cold receptor is present in a thermo- and hygroreceptive sensillum along with a moist receptor and a dry receptor, and the other is in a thermoreceptive and olfactory sensillum along with olfactory receptors. These two types of cold receptors were investigated using stimulations of constant temperature (T), stepwise decrease of temperature ({$\Delta$}T), and constant rates of temperature decrease (dT/dt).2.For cold receptors in the thermo- and hygroreceptive sensilla (C-H cells), steady-state activities are higher at lower constant temperatures (T) within the range of 16\textendash 31 \textdegree C examined (n = 7). On the other hand, those of the cold receptors in the thermoreceptive and olfactory sensilla (C-O cells) have individually a broad activity maximum in the range of 18\textendash 27 \textdegree C (n = 7).3.The differential sensitivity to downward temperature steps ({$\Delta$}T) of C-H cells was in the range of - 5.4 to - 12.4 (impulses/s)/\textdegree C (n = 11).

We therefore developed a stereoscopic display system for insects, using miniature 3D glasses to present separate images to each eye, and tested our ability to deliver stereoscopic illusions to praying mantises. We find that while filtering by circular polarization failed due to excessive crosstalk, "anaglyph" filtering by spectral content clearly succeeded in giving the mantis the illusion of 3D depth. We thus definitively demonstrate stereopsis in mantises and also demonstrate that the anaglyph technique can be effectively used to deliver virtual 3D stimuli to insects. This method opens up broad avenues of research into the parallel evolution of stereoscopic computations and possible new algorithms for depth perception.}

  abstract = {Extended periods of rest in Drosophila melanogaster resemble mammalian sleep states in that they are characterized by heightened arousal thresholds and specific alterations in gene expression [1, 2]. Defined as inactivity periods spanning 5 or more min, amounts of this sleep-like state are, as in mammals, sensitive to prior amounts of waking activity, time of day, and pharmacological intervention [1-3]. Clearly recognizable changes in the pattern and amount of brain electrical activity accompany changes in motor activity and arousal thresholds originally used to identify mammalian sleeping behavior [4-6]. Electroencephalograms (EEGs) and/or local field potentials (LFPs) are now widely used to quantify sleep state amounts and define types of sleep. Thus, slow-wave sleep (SWS) is characterized by EEG spindles and large-amplitude delta-frequency (0-3.5 Hz) waves. Rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep is characterized by irregular gamma-frequency cortical EEG patterns and rhythmic theta-frequency (5-9 Hz) hippocampal EEG activity [7]. It is unknown whether rest and activity in Drosophila are associated with distinct electrophysiological correlates. To address this issue, we monitored motor activity levels and recorded LFPs in the medial brain between the mushroom bodies, structures implicated in the modulation of locomotor activity, of Drosophila [8]. The results indicate that LFPs can be reliably recorded from the brains of awake, moving fruit flies, that targeted genetic manipulations can be used to localize sources of LFP activity, and that brain electrical activity of Drosophila is reliably correlated with activity state.},

Both RMR and MR during exercise (e.g. flight or running) in birds and mammals scale allometrically, although there is little consensus about the underlying mechanisms or the scaling relationships themselves. Even less is known about the allometric scaling of RMR and MR during exercise in insects. We analysed data on the resting and flight MR (FMR) of over 50 insect species that fly to determine whether RMR and FMR scale allometrically. RMR scaled with body mass to the power of 0.66 (M0.66), whereas FMR scaled with M1.10. Further analysis suggested that FMR scaled with two separate relationships; insects weighing less than 10{$\mkern1mu$}mg had fourfold lower FMR than predicted from the scaling of FMR in insects weighing more than 10{$\mkern1mu$}mg, although both groups scaled with M0.86. The scaling exponents of RMR and FMR in insects were not significantly different from those of birds and mammals, suggesting that they might be determined by similar factors. We argue that low FMR in small insects suggests these insects may be making considerable energy savings during flight, which could be extremely important for the physiology and evolution of insect flight.},

Using intracellular recordings from the intact retinas of four flies, Drosophila melanogaster, D. virilis, Calliphora vicina, and Sarcophaga carnaria, we measured the rates at which homologous R1\textendash 6 photoreceptors of these species transmit information from the same stimuli and estimated the energy they consumed. In all species, both information rate and energy consumption increase with light intensity. Energy consumption rises from a baseline, the energy required to maintain the dark resting potential. This substantial fixed cost, {$\sim$}20\% of a photoreceptor's maximum consumption, causes the unit cost of information (ATP molecules hydrolysed per bit) to fall as information rate increases. The highest information rates, achieved at bright daylight levels, differed according to species, from {$\sim$}200 bits s-1 in D. melanogaster to {$\sim$}1,000 bits s-1 in S. carnaria. Comparing species, the fixed cost, the total cost of signalling, and the unit cost (cost per bit) all increase with a photoreceptor's highest information rate to make information more expensive in higher performance cells. This law of diminishing returns promotes the evolution of economical structures by severely penalising overcapacity. Similar relationships could influence the function and design of many neurons because they are subject to similar biophysical constraints on information throughput.},

  abstract = {Miniaturized species have evolved in many animal lineages, including insects and vertebrates. Consequently, their nervous systems are constrained to fit within tiny volumes. These miniaturized nervous systems face two major challenges for information processing: noise and energy consumption. Fewer or smaller neurons with fewer molecular components will increase noise, affecting information processing and transmission. Smaller, more densely-packed neural processes will increase the density of energy consumption whilst reducing the space available for mitochondria, which supply energy. Although miniaturized nervous systems benefit from smaller distances between neurons, thus saving time, space and energy, they have also increased the space available for neural processing by expanding and contorting their nervous systems to fill any available space, sometimes at the expense of other structures. Other adaptations, such as multifunctional neurons or matched filters, may further alleviate the pressures on space within miniaturized nervous systems. Despite these adaptations, we argue that limitations on information processing are likely to affect the behaviour generated by miniaturized nervous systems. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

There was no correlation between body size and transpiration rate below 40\textdegree C except in the case of callow workers which showed a significant correlation at 25\textdegree C. There was evidence for a physical change in the cuticle at 40\textdegree C producing an acceleration in the rate of transpiration. The mean total body water content of workers was calculated as 77.2 {$\pm$} 6.2\%. Mortality was approx. 50\% when total body water fell to 46\%. Workers were found to be slightly more permeable to water than males and queens. Callow workers lost water at twice the rate as mature workers. Pupae were highly resistant to desiccation. Seasonal effects on the rate of transpiration could not be detected in workers exposed to temperatures below 40\textdegree C. Photoperiod was found to influence the choice of humidity by workers in a gradient apparatus. Under 16 h light-8 h dark, workers showed preference for the highest humidity; on 10 h light-14 h dark, they appeared indifferent. Callows chose the highest humidity (95\% r.h.). Formica rufa are probably tolerant of dry conditions sometimes experienced in temperate environments, photoperiod being important in the control of water balance.},

Combining real-time optical tracking and behavioral analysis with remote-controlled stimulus-reward boxes, this system allows direct interactions with animals in their habitat. EthoLoop continuously provides close-up views of the tracked individuals and thus allows high-resolution behavioral analysis using deep-learning methods. The behaviors detected on the fly can be automatically reinforced either by classical conditioning or by optogenetic stimulation via wirelessly controlled portable devices. Finally, by combining 3D tracking with wireless neurophysiology we demonstrate the existence of place-cell-like activity in the hippocampus of freely moving primates. Taken together, we show that the EthoLoop framework enables interactive, well-controlled and reproducible neuroethological studies in large-field naturalistic settings.},

After the optic nerves were severed (ONX), a weak but significant rhythmic expression persisted for per and tim under LD 12:12, while under DD, tim and cyc showed rhythmic expression. We also found that more than half of the ONX compound eyes exhibited weak but significant circadian electroretinographic rhythms.

The position of the tip of the antenna (flagellum) is controlled by two mobile joints at its base (the scape and the pedicel) and by the neck. Horizontal and vertical components of movement at the antennal basal joints exhibited rhythmic activities during locomotory (walking) and non-locomotory (pausing) states in the searching animal. In both states, the horizontal component was slower than vertical one. Joint-manipulation experiments suggested that the faster vertical component is due mainly to movements of the scape-pedicel joint, while the slower horizontal component may originate from the head-scape joint. Large horizontal deflections of the antenna corresponded consistently with the yaw component of head movement. The trajectories of the antennae showed little patterned regularity in most animals. In a few cases, however, loop-like patterns appeared. The area scanned by an antenna was narrower in the walking state than in the pausing state, mainly because of a decrease in the horizontal angular range. Cross-correlation analyses revealed that the coupling between right and left horizontal antennal motor systems and that for the vertical systems were both significantly stronger in the walking state than during pausing. These results indicate that the spatio-temporal pattern of antennal movements changes dynamically depending on the animal's behavioral state.},

Expensive methods of motion analysis involving the use of sophisticated technology has led to limited application of motion analysis in sports. Towards this, in this paper we have integrated a lowcost method for motion analysis using three axis accelerometer, three axis magnetometer and microcontroller which are very accurate and easy to use. Seventeen male subjects performed two experiments, standing short jumps and long jumps over a wide range of take-off angles. During take-off and landing the acceleration and angles at different joints of the body are recorded using accelerometers and magnetometers, and the data is captured using Lab VIEW software. Optimum take-off angle in these jumps are calculated using the recorded data, to identify the optimum projection angle that maximizes the distance achieved in a jump. The results obtained for optimum take off angle in short jump and long jump is in agreement with those obtained using other methodologies and theoretical calculations assuming jump to be a projectile motion. The impact force (acceleration) is also analysed and is found to progressively decrease from foot to neck.},

  abstract = {Mutualistic partners derive a benefit from their interaction, but this benefit can come at a cost. This is the case for plant-ant and plant-pollinator mutualistic associations. In exchange for protection from herbivores provided by the resident ants, plants supply various kinds of resources or nests to the ants. Most ant-myrmecophyte mutualisms are horizontally transmitted, and therefore, partners share an interest in growth but not in reproduction. This lack of alignment in fitness interests between plants and ants drives a conflict between them: ants can attack pollinators that cross-fertilize the host plants. Using a mathematical model, we define a threshold in ant aggressiveness determining pollinator survival or elimination on the host plant. In our model we observed that, all else being equal, facultative interactions result in pollinator extinction for lower levels of ant aggressiveness than obligatory interactions. We propose that the capacity to discriminate pollinators from herbivores should not often evolve in ants, and when it does it will be when the plants exhibit limited dispersal in an environment that is not seed saturated so that each seed produced can effectively generate a new offspring or if ants acquire an extra benefit from pollination (e.g. if ants eat fruit). We suggest specific mutualism examples where these hypotheses can be tested empirically. \textcopyright{} 2010 The Authors.

Here we study visual search in barn owls by tracking their overt attentional deployments\textemdash that is, their head movements\textemdash with a camera. We conducted a low-contrast feature search, a high-contrast orientation conjunction search, and a low- contrast orientation conjunction search, each with set sizes varying from 16 to 64 items. The barn owls were able to learn all of these tasks and showed serial search behavior. In a subsequent step, we analyzed how search behavior of owls changes with search complexity. We compared the search mechanisms in these three serial searches with results from pop-out searches our group had reported earlier. Saccade amplitude shortened and fixation duration increased in difficult searches. Also, in conjunction search saccades were guided toward items with shared target features. These data suggest that during visual search, barn owls utilize mechanisms similar to those that humans use.},

The angular component of the displacement is measured using a polarized-light compass associated with the functioning of the anterior median eyes. However, how L. tarantula estimates the linear component of the displacement was not known prior to this investigation. The ability of L. tarantula to gauge the distance walked after being displaced from its burrow was investigated using experimental channels placed in an indoor setup. Firstly, we manipulated the perception of visual stimuli by covering all the spider's eyes. Secondly, we changed the optic flow supplied by a black-and-white grating ({$\lambda$}=2 cm) perceived either in the lateral or in the ventral field of view. Finally, the period of the lateral or ventral grating was changed from {$\lambda$}=2 cm to {$\lambda$}=1 cm. Our results indicate that visual information contributes to distance estimation because when the spider's eyes were covered, the spiders tended to search for the burrow at very variable distances. This visual information is created by the motion of the image as the spider walks, the motion in the lateral field of view being the most important. The preference of a lateral optic flow over the ventral flow can be explained by the difference in the resolution capacity of the posterior lateral eyes and the anterior lateral eyes.},

However, the role of the secondary eyes [ALEs, posterior lateral eyes (PLEs) and posterior median eyes (PMEs)] in the perception of this optic flow and the importance of them for gauging the distance walked is still unknown. In this study, lateral or ventral gratings of wavelength {$\lambda$}=1 cm were used, with two groups of spiders in each setup: (1) PLEs+PMEs covered and (2) ALEs covered. The largest reduction in the distance walked to return to the burrow was observed with the ventral grating/ALEs covered.

We found, for example, that out of 28 programs, only 3 include a calibration algorithm to reduce image distortion and perspective problems that affect accuracy and can result in substantial errors when analyzing trajectories and extracting mobility or explored distance. In addition, only 4 programs can directly export in-depth tracking and analysis metrics, only 5 are suited for tracking multiple unmarked animals for more than a few seconds and only 11 have been updated in the period 2019\textendash 2021.}

  abstract = {In most sensory modalities the underlying physical phenomena are well understood, and stimulus properties can be precisely controlled. In olfaction, the situation is different. The presence of specific chemical compounds in the air (or water) is the root cause for perceived odors, but it remains unknown what organizing principles, equivalent to wavelength for light, determine the dimensions of odor space. Equally important, but less in the spotlight, odor stimuli are also complex with respect to their physical properties, including concentration and time-varying spatio-temporal distribution. We still lack a complete understanding or control over these properties, in either experiments or theory. In this review, we will concentrate on two important aspects of the physical properties of odor stimuli beyond the chemical identity of the odorants: (1) The amplitude of odor stimuli and their temporal dynamics. (2) The spatio-temporal structure of odor plumes in a natural environment. Concerning these issues, we ask the following questions: (1) Given any particular experimental protocol for odor stimulation, do we have a realistic estimate of the odorant concentration in the air, and at the olfactory receptor neurons? Can we control, or at least know, the dynamics of odorant concentration at olfactory receptor neurons? (2) What do we know of the spatio-temporal structure of odor stimuli in a natural environment both from a theoretical and experimental perspective? And how does this change if we consider mixtures of odorants? For both topics, we will briefly summarize the underlying principles of physics and review the experimental and theoretical Neuroscience literature, focusing on the aspects that are relevant to animals' physiology and behavior. We hope that by bringing the physical principles behind odor plume landscapes to the fore we can contribute to promoting a new generation of experiments and models.},

A limited number of researchers have focused on comparing male and female jumpers competing in international events, resulting in scarce findings in the literature regarding gender differences of the determinants of triple jump performance. Objective: The aim of the study was to examine the possible gender differences in the approach step characteristics, the spatiotemporal parameters of the separate phases of the triple jump as performed by athletes participating in sub-elite international events. Methods: The male and female participants of the 2015 European Team Championships triple jump event were recorded with a panning video camera. Approach speed was measured using photocells. Kinematical parameters were extracted using the APAS WIZARD 13.3.0.3 software. The relationships between the examined parameters and the actual triple jump performance were examined with Pearson's correlation analysis. Repeated measures ANOVA and chi-square statistical tests were run to examine the significance of the differences between genders. Results: Approach speed significantly correlated with the actual jumping distance in both males and females (p {$<$}.05). Significant gender differences (p {$<$}.05) existed concerning basic kinematical parameters. Men were found to have larger average horizontal speed of the 11 m to 1 m segment of the final approach, step length of the final six steps of the approach, step frequency of the final two steps, actual phase distances and percentage distribution of the step. Women, unlike men, used solely single arm swing techniques. No athlete executed the jump using a jump dominated technique. Conclusions: Gender differences in triple jump performance lies upon the kinematical parameters of the final two steps of the approach, the length of the step phase and the support time for the jump. The technique elements of the penultimate step are suggested to be the factor for the existence of these differences.},

Objective: The purpose of the study was to explore possible gender differences of the spatiotemporal parameters and their development during the final steps of the approach executed by elite jumpers during a major international competition. Methods: The jumpers competed in the 2009 International Amateur Athletics Federation World Athletics Final (7 males and 7 females; official distance: 7.83 {$\pm$} 0.22 m and 6.58 {$\pm$} 0.20 m, respectively) were recorded with a panning digital video-camera (sampling frequency: 210 fps, resolution: 480 \texttimes{} 366 pixels). The APAS v13.2.5 software was used for the kinematical analysis. Differences between groups concerning performance, the touchdown on the board and the take-off parameters were examined using the Mann-Whitney U test. Possible gender differences concerning the modulation of the examined parameters during the final three steps of the approach were compared by 2 \texttimes{} 3 (gender \texttimes{} step) ANOVA. Results: Male long jumpers executed the final steps of the approach and the take-off with greater velocity (p = .001) compared to the female athletes. Gender differences (p = .04) were also revealed for the flight to contact time ratio of the penultimate step. Additionally, no gender differences were observed for the majority of the temporal parameters. Nevertheless, female jumpers seemed to significantly differentiate in step length, step frequency and step velocity only at the last step of their approach compared to the previous two steps. Conclusion: When examining gender differences in long jump biomechanics the defining parameter is the penultimate step, where it is suggested for female jumpers to improve the transition from the sprinting gait to the preparation for the take-off.},

Additional realistic hypotheses, such as the assumption that metabolic cost at a given power should be minimal (the fixed gear hypothesis), a nonlinear dependence of the energy storage rate on propulsion and/or a preferred average speed, allow us to generalize the model and demonstrate the flexibility of intermittent locomotion with implications for biological and artificial systems. \textcopyright{} 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Yet contrary to this view, studies suggest that progress is slowing in several major fields10,11.

In numerous social insect lineages, a morphologically and behaviourally distinct soldier caste specializes in colony defence, with larger foragers typically engaging most in the aggressive defence of the colony against external threats. We hypothesized, however, that specialization in aggression could show vastly different patterns in the context of the defence against small intranidal parasites that prey on brood. This is because we expected that small, intranidal nurse workers could be better suited to defend against these parasitic myrmecophiles (=ant associates) due to their better matching size, high encounter rate and the high task switching costs that would occur if foragers had to carry out this task. Here, we present data that support this hypothesis from a study on specialization in defence against two parasites in the red wood ant Formica rufa. In particular, we show that small workers displayed the strongest aggressive behaviour towards the parasitic rove beetle Thiasophila angulata and the spider Thyreosthenius biovatus, and present evidence that small workers were better at preventing brood predation than larger workers. In addition, there was worker task specialization in defensive behaviour, with nurses and workers at nest entrances being more aggressive towards T.angulata than extranidal foragers. We argue that this context-dependent specialization in aggression and nest defence was likely to be important in favouring the pronounced worker polymorphism observed in both this and other ant species and discuss our findings in relation to models for the evolution of division of labour and caste polymorphism in insect societies.},

METHODS: Twelve male moderately trained competitive runners performed a self-paced 5-km running reference time trial followed by a three 5-km running self-paced trials under different optic flow conditions (RNORM = actual running speed, RSLOW = actual speed - 25\%, and RFAST = actual speed + 25\%). Participants were asked to self-report RPE when they thought they had reached each kilometer. RESULTS: There was no difference in the 5-km completion times (P {$>$} 0.05) or actual pace (P {$>$} 0.05) between the optic flow conditions. A greater distance was covered between the perceived kilometer points during RSLOW compared with RNORM (P {$<$} 0.01) and RFAST (P {$<$} 0.01). RPE (normalized for running distance) was lower during RSLOW compared with RNORM (P {$<$} 0.01) and RFAST (P {$<$} 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Different rates of optic flow lead to an apparent compression or elongation of perceived distance during running, with slow optic flow resulting in an increased ratio of perceived to actual running distance. Pacing was not different in the slow optic flow condition, despite lower perceived exertion, which is contrary to the predictions of the RPE template model, hazard scores, and estimated time limits.},

The device uses infrared sensors to monitor and record the locomotor activity of the animals, which is later analyzed. The software package consists of two separate scripts: the first designed to manage the acquisition and the evolution of the experiment, the second designed to generate actograms and perform various analyses to detect periodicity in the data (e.g., Fourier power spectra, chi-squared periodograms, and Lomb\textendash Scargle periodograms).

  abstract = {Neural networks in vertebrates exhibit endogenous oscillations that have been associated with functions ranging from sensory processing to locomotion. It remains unclear whether oscillations may play a similar role in the insect brain. We describe a novel "whole brain" readout for Drosophila melanogaster using a simple multichannel recording preparation to study electrical activity across the brain of flies exposed to different sensory stimuli. We recorded local field potential (LFP) activity from {$>$}2,000 registered recording sites across the fly brain in {$>$}200 wild-type and transgenic animals to uncover specific LFP frequency bands that correlate with: 1) brain region; 2) sensory modality (olfactory, visual, or mechanosensory); and 3) activity in specific neural circuits. We found endogenous and stimulus-specific oscillations throughout the fly brain. Central (higher-order) brain regions exhibited sensory modality-specific increases in power within narrow frequency bands. Conversely, in sensory brain regions such as the optic or antennal lobes, LFP coherence, rather than power, best defined sensory responses across modalities. By transiently activating specific circuits via expression of TrpA1, we found that several circuits in the fly brain modulate LFP power and coherence across brain regions and frequency domains. However, activation of a neuromodulatory octopaminergic circuit specifically increased neuronal coherence in the optic lobes during visual stimulation while decreasing coherence in central brain regions. Our multichannel recording and brain registration approach provides an effective way to track activity simultaneously across the fly brain in vivo, allowing investigation of functional roles for oscillations in processing sensory stimuli and modulating behavior. \textcopyright{} 2013 the American Physiological Society.},

  abstract = {UNLABELLED: A crucial function of the brain is to be able to distinguish whether or not changes in the environment are caused by one's own actions. Even the smallest brains appear to be capable of making this distinction, as has been shown by closed-loop behavioral experiments in flies controlling visual stimuli in virtual reality paradigms. We questioned whether activity in the fruit fly brain is different during such closed-loop behavior, compared with passive viewing of a stimulus. To address this question, we used a procedure to record local field potential (LFP) activity across the fly brain while flies were controlling a virtual object through their movement on an air-supported ball. The virtual object was flickered at a precise frequency (7 Hz), creating a frequency tag that allowed us to track brain responses to the object while animals were behaving. Following experiments under closed-loop control, we replayed the same stimulus to the fly in open loop, such that it could no longer control the stimulus. We found identical receptive fields and similar strength of frequency tags across the brain for the virtual object under closed loop and replay. However, when comparing central versus peripheral brain regions, we found that brain responses were differentially modulated depending on whether flies were in control or not. Additionally, coherence of LFP activity in the brain increased when flies were in control, compared with replay, even if motor behavior was similar. This suggests that processes associated with closed-loop control promote temporal coordination in the insect brain. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: We show that closed-loop control of a visual stimulus promotes temporal coordination across the Drosophila brain, compared with open-loop replay of the same visual sequences. This is significant because it suggests that, to understand goal-directed behavior or visual attention in flies, it may be most informative to sample neural activity from multiple regions across the brain simultaneously, and to examine temporal relationships (e.g., coherence) between these regions.},

To overcome the limitations of video playback and other open loop systems that are currently available for the study of visually mediated behaviour in jumping spiders, we developed a closed-loop, virtual reality (VR) system in which a spider on a spherical treadmill walks through a projected 3D world that updates in real time in response to its movements. To investigate VR as an experimental technique for spiders as well as validate it as a proxy of the real world, we conducted two experiments to assess whether individual behavioural tendencies and learning transferred from real to virtual environments. In the first experiment, we examined transference of individual behaviour tendencies (spontaneous locomotion and dark/light preference) between real and VR environments, and found that individual differences were conserved. In the second experiment, we investigated transference of beacon-learning tasks between real and VR environments. We found that spiders that had learned a beacon-nest site association in the real world tended to expresses similar associations in the virtual world. Virtual reality offers great promise as a new tool to explore the cognitive processes underlying vision-mediated learning, memory and navigation in jumping spiders. \textbullet We created an immersive virtual reality system for jumping spiders.},

In south-west Scotland the activity cycle of the adult forms a bimodal curve, the peak in activity in June being followed by an inactive period which lasts until early September when the animals again become active and breed. 2. The life history of Nebria brevicollis was found to differ from that reported for the species in England only in the later pupation of the third instar larva in spring and in the subsequent emergence of the teneral adults. 3. The breeding life of a female N. brevicollis kept in an insectary is 27 days, eggs being laid at the rate of 1.2 per day. 4. Each stage of the life cycle was reared and some observations are made on the behaviour, food requirements and development of the larvae. 5. The population density of the new generation of adult N. brevicollis was determined in June 1962, 1963 and 1964 by a mark-recapture technique. It was found to be between 0.6 and 0.9 adults/m2. The highest numbers were caught in traps under trees where the litter layer was deep and few were caught in wet areas. 6. Small diptera formed about 38\% of the diet of an adult N. brevicollis, collembola 32\%, mites 23\%, spiders 4\% and small earthworms 3\%. There is selection of food up to 4 mm in length and it is suggested that collembola are eaten in preference to mites.},

The teneral adults are active for about 3 weeks in June when they feed actively and build up large food reserves. During diapause the population is inactive, aggregated under logs and stones; energy for body maintenance is supplied by the oxidation of their food reserves. 2. Three main theories have been put forward concerning possible factors controlling diapause. However, when investigated experimentally they proved to be invalid: diapause is not controlled by adverse low humidity or high temperatures during the summer; photoperiod does not affect the occurrence of diapause, nor do the animals use the diapause period to develop their gonads. 3. Food supply was found to be the important factor, and it is suggested that the ultimate reason for diapause is the avoidance of conditions of low food supply in the sparse woodland litter during the summer. The onset of diapause appears to be regulated by the fat content of the body, and it can be prevented by starving the animals before the normal onset of diapause. After diapause is completed, short photoperiod stimulates maturation of the gonads.},

This has opened up a new field of computational ethology and will, in the near future, make it possible to quantify in near completeness what an animal is doing as it navigates its environment. The importance of improving the techniques with which we characterize behavior is reflected in the emerging recognition that understanding behavior is an essential (or even prerequisite) step to pursuing neuroscience questions. The use of these methods, however, is not limited to studying behavior in the wild or in strictly ethological settings. Modern tools for behavioral quantification can be applied to the full gamut of approaches that have historically been used to link brain to behavior, from psychophysics to cognitive tasks, augmenting those measurements with rich descriptions of how animals navigate those tasks. Here we review recent technical advances in quantifying behavior, particularly in methods for tracking animal motion and characterizing the structure of those dynamics. We discuss open challenges that remain for behavioral quantification and highlight promising future directions, with a strong emphasis on emerging approaches in deep learning, the core technology that has enabled the markedly rapid pace of progress of this field. We then discuss how quantitative descriptions of behavior can be leveraged to connect brain activity with animal movements, with the ultimate goal of resolving the relationship between neural circuits, cognitive processes and behavior.},

We will review the diverse developmental strategies that can be observed among plants by detailing the effect of phosphate deficiency on primary and lateral roots. We also discuss the formation of cluster roots: an advanced adaptive strategy to cope with low phosphate availability observed in a limited number of species.

Here we study scaling in the compound eyes of workers of the wood ant, Formica rufa, from different colonies within a single population. Workers' eye area increased with body size in all the colonies showing a negative allometry. However, both the slope and intercept of some allometric scaling relationships differed significantly among colonies. Moreover, though mean facet diameter and facet number increased with body size, some colonies primarily increased facet number whereas others increased facet diameter, showing that the cellular level processes underlying organ scaling differed among colonies. Thus, the rules that govern scaling at the organ and cellular levels can differ even within a single population.}

Cortical neurons that encode different types of information are spatially intermingled and distributed over large brain volumes5\textendash 7, and this complexity has hindered attempts to probe the function of these subnetworks by perturbing them individually8. Here we use computational modelling, optical recordings and manipulations to probe the function of recurrent coupling in layer 2/3 of the mouse vibrissal somatosensory cortex during active tactile discrimination. A neural circuit model of layer 2/3 revealed that recurrent excitation enhances sensory signals by amplification, but only for subnetworks with increased connectivity. Model networks with high amplification were sensitive to damage: loss of a few members of the subnetwork degraded stimulus encoding. We tested this prediction by mapping neuronal selectivity7 and photoablating9,10 neurons with specific selectivity. Ablation of a small proportion of layer 2/3 neurons (10\textendash 20, less than 5\% of the total) representing touch markedly reduced responses in the spared touch representation, but not in other representations. Ablations most strongly affected neurons with stimulus responses that were similar to those of the ablated population, which is also consistent with network models. Recurrence among cortical neurons with similar selectivity therefore drives input-specific amplification during behaviour.},

This is localized to the mushroom bodies and antennal lobes and organized by a network of hierarchically arranged modulatory circuits, especially those involving octopamine and dopamine. Neurogenetic studies with Drosophila have identified distinct circuit elements for reward learning, "wanting," and possibly "liking" in Drosophila, suggesting a modular structure to the insect reward processing system, which broadly parallels that of the mammals in terms of functional organization.},

This possibility has traditionally been dismissed by many as emotions are frequently defined with reference to human subjective experience, and invertebrates are often not considered to have the neural requirements for such sophisticated abilities. However, emotions are understood in humans and other vertebrates to be multifaceted brain states, comprising dissociable subjective, cognitive, behavioural and physiological components. In addition, accumulating literature is providing evidence of the impressive cognitive capacities and behavioural flexibility of invertebrates. Alongside these, within the past few years, a number of studies have adapted methods for assessing emotions in humans and other animals, to invertebrates, with intriguing results. Sea slugs, bees, crayfish, snails, crabs, flies and ants have all been shown to display various cognitive, behavioural and/ or physiological phenomena that indicate internal states reminiscent of what we consider to be emotions. Given the limited neural architecture of many invertebrates, and the powerful tools available within invertebrate research, these results provide new opportunities for unveiling the neural mechanisms behind emotions and open new avenues towards the pharmacological manipulation of emotion and its genetic dissection, with advantages for disease research and therapeutic drug discovery. Here, we review the increasing evidence that invertebrates display some form of emotion, discuss the various methods used for assessing emotions in invertebrates and consider what can be garnered fromfurtheremotion research on invertebrates in terms of the evolution and underlying neural basis of emotion in a comparative context.},

The present study was designed to clarify the mechanical loading characteristics and the role of neuromuscular function in the triple jump. Seven national triple jumpers (4 males, 3 females) volunteered to perform 3{$\pm$} 6 jumps. The mean best performances were 14.32 {$\pm$} 0.45 m and 11.90 {$\pm$} 0.28 m for males and females, respectively. The three longest triple jumps for each jumper were selected for final analysis. The mean contact times were 0.139 s (hop), 0.157 s (step) and 0.177 s (jump). The largest ground reaction forces were observed in the step (15.2 times body weight), while the highest peak pressures were recorded under the heel and forefoot. The plantar pressure of the lateral side of the forefoot was highly related to the length of the triple jump (P {$<$} 0.05{$\pm$} 0.01). In addition, electromyograms of both legs suggested that mechanical loading places high demands on the neuromuscular system, as characterized by the high rate of activation in the pre-activity phase followed by high eccentric activity. Thus, the high activities of the gastrocnemius, vastus lateralis and hip extensor muscles seem to play an important role in preventing unnecessary yielding of the jumper during the braking phase. \textcopyright{} 2000 Taylor \& Francis Ltd.},

The present paper discusses how these principles can be heeded by experimental scientists to advance the understanding of the brain basis of behavior. It is suggested that a profitable way forward is to focus on investigating the dynamic multivariate structure of brain data. Accordingly, central research problems involve characterizing ``neural trajectories'' and the associated geometry of the underlying ``neural space.'' Finally, it is argued that, at a time when the development of neurotechniques has reached a fever pitch, neuroscience needs to redirect its focus and invest comparable energy in the conceptual and theoretical dimensions of its research endeavor.

  abstract = {Hymenoptera (sawflies, wasps, ants, and bees) are one of four mega-diverse insect orders, comprising more than 153,000 described and possibly up to one million undescribed extant species [1, 2]. As parasitoids, predators, and pollinators, Hymenoptera play a fundamental role in virtually all terrestrial ecosystems and are of substantial economic importance [1, 3]. To understand the diversification and key~evolutionary transitions of Hymenoptera, most notably from phytophagy to parasitoidism and predation (and vice versa) and from solitary to eusocial life, we inferred the phylogeny and divergence times of all major lineages of Hymenoptera by analyzing 3,256 protein-coding genes in 173 insect species. Our analyses suggest that extant Hymenoptera started to diversify around 281 million years ago (mya). The primarily ectophytophagous sawflies are found to be monophyletic. The species-rich lineages of parasitoid wasps constitute a monophyletic group as well. The little-known, species-poor Trigonaloidea are identified as the sister group of the stinging wasps (Aculeata). Finally, we located the evolutionary root of bees within the apoid wasp family ``Crabronidae.'' Our results reveal that the extant sawfly diversity is largely the result of a previously unrecognized major radiation of phytophagous Hymenoptera that did not lead to wood-dwelling and parasitoidism. They also confirm that all primarily parasitoid wasps are descendants of a single endophytic parasitoid ancestor that lived around 247 mya. Our findings provide the basis for a natural classification of Hymenoptera and allow for future comparative analyses of Hymenoptera, including their genomes, morphology, venoms, and parasitoid and eusocial life styles.},

Distance information was thought to be provided by optic flow (OF)\textemdash that is, image motion experienced during travel\textemdash but this idea was abandoned when stride integration was discovered as an odometer mechanism in ants. We show that ants transported by nest mates are capable of measuring travel distance exclusively by the use of OF cues. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the information gained from the optic flowmeter cannot be transferred to the stride integrator. Our results suggest a dual information channel that allows the ants to measure distances by strides and OF cues, although both systems operate independently and in a redundant manner.},

  abstract = {The L\'evy walk hypothesis asserts that the optimal search strategy for a forager under specific conditions is to make successive movement steps that have uniformly random directions and lengths drawn from a probability distribution that is heavy-tailed. This idea has generated a huge amount of interest, with numerous studies providing empirical evidence in support of the hypothesis and others criticising some of the methods employed in these. The most common method for identifying L\'evy walk behaviour in movement data is to fit a set of candidate distributions to the observed step lengths using maximum likelihood methods. Commonly used candidate distributions are the exponential distribution and the power-law (Pareto) distribution, both on an infinite and a finite (truncated) range. Data sets for which the relative fit of a power-law distribution is better than that of an exponential are typically classified as L\'evy walks. However, the movement pattern of the L\'evy walk is similar to that of an animal that switches between two behavioural modes in a composite correlated random walk (CCRW) movement process. Recent studies have shown that standard approaches can misidentify the CCRW process as a Levy walk. This misidentification can be due to the methods used to sample and process the data, a failure to assess the absolute fit of the candidate distributions, or the lack of a strong alternative model. In this chapter, we simulate a CCRW process and show that including a composite exponential distribution in the set of candidate distributions can alleviate the problem of misidentification. However, in some cases sampling and processing of the CCRW data can cause a power-law distribution to have a better fit than a composite exponential. In such cases, the absolute goodness-of-fit of the power-law distribution is typically poor, indicating that none of the candidate distributions are a good model for the data. We discuss the relevance of these results for the analysis of empirical movement data. \textcopyright{} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Measures to control and perhaps to stop and reverse such invasive processes are urgently needed. Mathematical models are a suitable tool to preview the impact of control measures before utilizing them in nature. Here, a reaction-diffusion model is used to describe the competition and dispersal of invasive and native species. Not only the environment is changing but also growth, harvesting and dispersal of the two competitors vary in space and time. Extreme events such as fires or landslides or any other processes yielding bare re-invadable ground lead to temporary extinction of both species at a randomly chosen time and spatial range. The spatiotemporal dimension of these extreme fragmentation events, the ratio of the dispersal rates of the competing species as well as the selective removal of the invader turn out to be the crucial driving forces of the system dynamics. Finally, the controlling effect of a targeted infection of the invasive species with a specific pathogen is studied in an eco-epidemiological competition-diffusion model. \textcopyright{} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Consequently, the idea of using substrate-borne vibrations for pest control is still in its infancy. This review therefore focuses on the theoretical background, using it to highlight potential applications in a field environment, and lists the few preliminary studies that have been or are being performed.

Thus, individuals on the ``fast'' end of POLS continuum grow faster, exhibit higher metabolism, are more risk prone, but die earlier than ones on the ``slow'' end. Empirical support is nevertheless mixed and modelling studies suggested POLS to vary along selection gradients. Therefore, including ecological variation when testing POLS is vastly needed to determine whether POLS is a fixed construct or the result of specific selection processes. Here, we tested POLS predictions between and within two fish populations originating from different ecological conditions. We observed opposing life histories between populations, characterized by differential investments into growth, fecundity, and functional morphology under identical laboratory conditions. A slower life history was, on average, associated with boldness (latency to emergence from a refuge), high activity (short freezing time and long distance travelled), and increased standard metabolism. Correlation structures among POLS traits were not consistent between populations, with the expression of POLS observed in the slow-growing but not in the fast-growing population. Our results suggest that POLS traits can evolve independently from one another and that their coevolution depends upon specific ecological processes.},

  abstract = {This essay develops the idea of surveillance publishing, with special attention to the example of Elsevier. A scholarly publisher can be defined as a surveillance publisher if it derives a substantial proportion of its revenue from prediction products, fueled by data extracted from researcher behavior. The essay begins by tracing the Google search engine's roots in bibliometrics, alongside a history of the citation analysis company that became, in 2016, Clarivate. The point is to show the co-evolution of scholarly communication and the surveillance advertising economy. The essay then refines the idea of surveillance publishing by engaging with the work of Shoshana Zuboff, Jathan Sadowski, Mariano-Florentino Cu\'ellar, and Aziz Huq. The recent history of Elsevier is traced to describe the company's research-lifecycle data-harvesting strategy, with the aim to develop and sell prediction products to universities and other customers. The essay concludes by considering some of the potential costs of surveillance publishing, as other big commercial publishers increasingly enter the predictive-analytics mark. It is likely, I argue, that windfall subscription-and-APC profits in Elsevier's ``legacy'' publishing business have financed its decade-long acquisition binge in analytics, with the implication that university customers are budgetary victims twice over. The products' purpose, I stress, is to streamline the top-down assessment and evaluation practices that have taken hold in recent decades, in tandem with the view that the university's main purpose is to grow regional and national economies. A final pair of concerns is that publishers' prediction projects may camouflage and perpetuate existing biases in the system\textemdash and that scholars may internalize an analytics mindset, one already encouraged by citation counts and impact factors.},

In all cases, when elicited by square wave light pulses longer than 400ms, light adapted (LA) ERGs consisted of four component waveforms: a cornea negative transient and sustained ON, a cornea negative transient OFF, and a cornea positive sustained OFF. The former two ON, and the latter OFF components were attributed to photoreceptor depolarization and repolarization, respectively. Metabolic stress via CO2 induced anoxia selectively eliminated the transient OFF (independent of its effect on the other components) suggesting the transient OFF represents activity of the lamina interneurons on which the photoreceptors synapse. Dark adapted (DA) ERGs differed from LA ERGs in that the sustained ON and OFF amplitudes were larger, and the transient ON and OFF components were absent. Increased stimulus durations increased the amplitudes and derivatives of, and decreased the latencies to the maximum amplitudes of the OFF components. Increasing stimulus intensity increased the amplitude of the sustained ON and OFF components, but not the transient OFF. These results suggest that the mantis' visual system displays increased contrast coding efficiency with increased light adaptation, and that there are differences in gain between photoreceptor and lamina interneuron responses. Finally, responses to luminance decrements as brief a 1ms were evident in LA recordings, and were resolved at frequencies up to 60Hz.},

However, the mechanisms by which alpha oscillations affect human cognition await demonstration. Here, we suggest the honey bee brain as an experimentally more accessible model system for investigating the functional role of alpha oscillations. We found a prominent spontaneous oscillation around 18 Hz that is reduced in amplitude upon olfactory stimulation. Similar to alpha oscillations in primates, the phase of this oscillation biased both timing of neuronal spikes and amplitude of high-frequency gamma activity (40\textendash 450 Hz). These results suggest a common role of alpha oscillations across phyla and provide an unprecedented new venue for causal studies on the relationship between neuronal spikes, brain oscillations and cognition.},

An animated moving walkway was created in 3D Studio Max and rendered into a stereoscopic movie using Virtalis StereoWorks. The movie was projected (moving toward the subjects) onto a 5m wide screen in front of a self-paced treadmill. The movie was projected at three different speed conditions (0.75m/s, 1.5m/s and 3.0m/s) in counterbalanced order. Nine participants were instructed to maintain 'comfortable walking speed' throughout the 5-minute duration of each speed condition. A significant difference was found between the mean walking speeds of the participants at different animation speeds (ANOVA p {$<$} 0.01); with lower animation speed associated with faster walking speeds and vice versa. This modulating effect was sustained for the duration of each 5-minute test, which suggests that it does have potential for use in rehabilitation and training. This study used healthy subjects, and further work is proposed to investigate the extent of this modulating effect on clinical groups. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)}

Using the long-term pitfall trap capture data from 12 terrestrial Environmental Change Network (ECN) sites from the UK, we examined how changing climate influenced the phenology of common carabids, and the role particular climate components had on phenological parameters. Of the 28 species included in the analyses, 19 showed earlier start of their activity. This advance was particularly pronounced in the spring, supporting the view that early phenophases have a greater tendency to change and these changes are more directly controlled by temperature than later ones. Autumn activity extended only a few cases, suggesting a photoperiod-driven start of hibernation. No association was found between life-history traits and the ability of species to change their phenology. Air temperatures between April and June were the most important factors determining the start of activity of each species, whilst late season precipitation hastened the cessation of activity. The balance between the advantages and disadvantages of changing phenology on various levels is likely to depend on the species and even on local environmental criteria. The substantially changing phenology of Carabidae may influence their function in ecosystems and the ecosystem services they provide.},

  abstract = {The study of bacterial ion channels has provided fundamental insights into the structural basis of neuronal signalling; however, the native role of ion channels in bacteria has remained elusive. Here we show that ion channels conduct long-range electrical signals within bacterial biofilm communities through spatially propagating waves of potassium. These waves result from a positive feedback loop, in which a metabolic trigger induces release of intracellular potassium, which in turn depolarizes neighbouring cells. Propagating through the biofilm, this wave of depolarization coordinates metabolic states among cells in the interior and periphery of the biofilm. Deletion of the potassium channel abolishes this response. As predicted by a mathematical model, we further show that spatial propagation can be hindered by specific genetic perturbations to potassium channel gating. Together, these results demonstrate a function for ion channels in bacterial biofilms, and provide a prokaryotic paradigm for active, long-range electrical signalling in cellular communities.},

In this article, two of the major model systems used to study the evolution and development (evo\textendash devo) of cave animals are described: the teleost fish Astyanax mexicanus and the isopod crustacean Asellus aquaticus. The ways in which these animals match the major attributes expected of an evo\textendash devo cave animal model system are described. For both species, we enumerate the regressive and constructive troglomorphic traits that have evolved during their adaptation to cave life, the developmental and genetic basis of these traits, the possible evolutionary forces responsible for them, and potential new areas in which these model systems could be used for further exploration of the evolution of cave animals. Furthermore, we compare the two model cave animals to investigate the mechanisms of troglomorphic evolution. Finally, we propose a few other cave animal systems that would be suitable for development as additional models to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the developmental and genetic mechanisms involved in troglomorphic evolution.

However, compounds (triazolobenzodiazepines such as adinazolam and alprazolam, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) that have a different spectrum of therapeutic efficacy in anxiety disorders such as panic attacks, generalized anxiety disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder were poorly effective as anxiolytics in the open field test, suggesting that this paradigm may not model features of anxiety disorders.

Such awareness is necessary, but not sufficient to address the varied mental health needs of elite athletes. We call for a new model of intervention and outline the backbone of a comprehensive mental health framework to promote athlete mental health and wellbeing, and respond to the needs of athletes who are at-risk of developing, or already experiencing mental health symptoms or disorders. Early detection of, and intervention for, mental health symptoms is essential in the elite sporting context. Such approaches help build cultures that acknowledge that an athlete's mental health needs are as important as their physical health needs, and that both are likely to contribute to optimising the athlete's overall wellbeing in conjunction with performance excellence. The proposed framework aims at (i) helping athletes develop a range of self-management skills that they can utilise to manage psychological distress, (ii) equipping key stakeholders in the elite sporting environment (such as coaches, sports medicine and high-performance support staff) to better recognise and respond to concerns regarding an athlete's mental health and (iii) highlighting the need for specialist multi-disciplinary teams or skilled mental health professionals to manage athletes with severe or complex mental disorders. Combined, these components ensure that elite athletes receive the intervention and support that they need at the right time, in the right place, with the right person.},

Four elite (100-m best time 9.95-10.29s) and five sub-elite (10.40-10.60s) sprinters performed seven sprints in overground conditions. A single virtual 40-m sprint was reconstructed and kinetics parameters were calculated for each step using a force platform system and video analyses. Anteroposterior force (F{$<$}inf{$>$}Y{$<$}/inf{$>$}), power (P{$<$}inf{$>$}Y{$<$}/inf{$>$}), and the ratio of the horizontal force component to the resultant (total) force (RF, which reflects the orientation of the resultant ground reaction force for each support phase) were computed as a function of velocity (V). F{$<$}inf{$>$}Y{$<$}/inf{$>$}-V, RF-V, and P{$<$}inf{$>$}Y{$<$}/inf{$>$}-V relationships were well described by significant linear (mean R\textsuperscript{2} of 0.892{$\pm$}0.049 and 0.950{$\pm$}0.023) and quadratic (mean R\textsuperscript{2}=0.732{$\pm$}0.114) models, respectively. The current study allows a better understanding of the mechanics of the sprint acceleration notably by modeling the relationships between the forward velocity and the main mechanical key variables of the sprint. As these findings partly concern world-class sprinters tested in overground conditions, they give new insights into some aspects of the biomechanical limits of human locomotion.},

Across phyla, however, an understanding of the mechanisms underlying oscillations and how these link to behavior remains limited. Here, we discover compound delta oscillations in the sleep-regulating R5 network of Drosophila. We find that the power of these slow-wave oscillations increases with sleep need and is subject to diurnal variation. Optical multi-unit voltage recordings reveal that single R5 neurons get synchronized by activating circadian input pathways. We show that this synchronization depends on NMDA receptor (NMDAR) coincidence detector function, and that an interplay of cholinergic and glutamatergic inputs regulates oscillatory frequency. Genetically targeting the coincidence detector function of NMDARs in R5, and thus the uncovered mechanism underlying synchronization, abolished network-specific compound slow-wave oscillations. It also disrupted sleep and facilitated light-induced wakening, establishing a role for slow-wave oscillations in regulating sleep and sensory gating. We therefore propose that the synchronization-based increase in oscillatory power likely represents an evolutionarily conserved, potentially ``optimal,'' strategy for constructing sleep-regulating sensory gates.},

More specifically, it is debated whether reward effects are mediated through changes in sensory processing and/or later stages of decision making. To address this question, we conducted two experiments in which human subjects made saccades to what they perceived to be the first or second of two visually identical but asynchronously presented targets, while we manipulated expected reward from correct and incorrect responses on each trial. We found that unequal reward caused similar shifts in target selection (reward bias) between the two experiments. Moreover, observed reward biases were independent of the individual's sensitivity to sensory signals. These findings suggest that the observed reward effects were determined heuristically via modulation of decision-making processes instead of sensory processing and thus, are more compatible with response bias rather than perceptual bias. To further explain our findings and uncover plausible neural mechanisms, we simulated our experiments with a cortical network model and tested alternative mechanisms for how reward could exert its influence. We found that our observations are more compatible with reward-dependent input to the output layer of the decision circuit. Together, our results suggest that during a temporal judgment task, the influence of reward information on perceptual choice is more compatible with changing later stages of decision making rather than early sensory processing.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

There is a large literature dealing with this subject,, but no completely satisfactory quantitative relationships between energy expenditure and speed of walking in normal subjects have been established. PASSNOR]\textasciitilde{} and Du\textasciitilde NI\textasciitilde{} (1955), in their review of human energy expenditure, compiled data of earlier investigators and found that energy expenditure could be represented as a linear function of speed in the range 50-100 meters/rain. This relationship, while of considerable practical usefulness, is not very satisfying since it holds only for restricted body weight and does not lend itself to any theoretical deductions. COTES, MEADE and WISE (1957) have developed an equation in which energy expenditure during walking is expressed as a linear function of lift-work. This equation adequately predicts energy expenditure for speeds up to about 110 meters/min. The equation is not satisfactory for much higher speeds, and its usefulness for certain deductive purposes is limited by its rather complex mathematical form and by the considerable number of variables which it contains. It is the purpose of this paper to establish a mathematical relationship between energy expenditure and speed which is useful in the sense that it is simple and of suggestive physical form, having adequate predictive value and lending itself to deductions of other interesting features of energy expenditure during walking.},

The analysis showed that each style of jumping requires specific and significantly different amounts of angular momentum in order to produce acceptable landing configurations. However, it is shown that given the proper angular momentum at take-off, the three styles of jumping are equally effective. A method is suggested whereby one can measure the angular momentum at take-off and use it to further study the long jump and make applications to training. \textcopyright{} 1973 Taylor 8 Francis Group, LLC.},

The vertical force records for each phase showed two peaks having magnitudes in the range of 7 to 12 times body weight (BW) and 3.3 to 5 BW, respectively. These magnitudes are substantially higher than has been reported by others for distance running, sprinting, and in some cases other jumps. The maximum horizontal forces act to decrease the velocity of the mass center, but to different degrees for the different subjects. The data show that for any phase of the jump there is considerable variability in the timing and magnitudes of the force records among the different subjects although general patterns are similar. The results suggest that the use of mean force data from a number of subjects may conceal important differences between the way individuals execute the jump.}

Defined as a distinct state of reduced activity, arousability, attention, and initiative, it is well established in mammals, birds, reptiles, and teleosts. It is commonly defined by additional electroencephalographic criteria that are only well established in mammals and to some extent in birds. Sleep states similar to those in mammals, except for electrical criteria, seem to occur in some invertebrates, based on behavior and some physiological observations. Currently the most compelling evidence for sleep in invertebrates (evidence that meets most standard criteria for sleep) has been obtained in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. However, in mammals, sleep is also characterized by a brain state different from that at rest but awake. The electrophysiological slow wave criterion for this state is not seen in Drosophila or in honey bees. Here, we show that, in crayfish, a behavioral state with elevated threshold for vibratory stimulation is accompanied by a distinctive form of slow wave electrical activity of the brain, quite different from that during waking rest. Therefore, crayfish can attain a sleep state comparable to that of mammals.},

Pearson's correlations, Winsorized correlations, and the HC4 method were used to determine significant correlations between variables ({$\alpha$} = .05). Within-jumper analysis indicated that when jumpers initiate the takeoff phase with a larger leg angle they are able to generate significantly greater negative horizontal and positive net vertical impulses (n = 7). Increased impulse generation was the result of increased contact time (n = 5 of 7) and/or increased average reaction force (n = 4) during the impact interval (n = 3) and/or postimpact interval (n = 4), depending on the individual. Initial leg configuration at contact and individual specific impulse generation strategies are important to consider when determining how an athlete with initial momentum can increase impulse generation to jump for distance.},

As with any biological process, the functions of sleep can only be fully understood when examined in the ecological context in which they evolved. Owing to technological constraints, until recently, sleep has primarily been examined in the artificial laboratory environment. However, new tools are enabling researchers to study sleep behaviour and neurophysiology in the wild. Here, we summarize the various methods that have enabled sleep researchers to go wild, their strengths and weaknesses, and the discoveries resulting from these first steps outside the laboratory. The initial studies to `go wild' have revealed a wealth of interindividual variation in sleep, and shown that sleep duration is not even fixed within an individual, but instead varies in response to an assortment of ecological demands. Determining the costs and benefits of this inter- and intraindividual variation in sleep may reveal clues to the functions of sleep. Perhaps the greatest surprise from these initial studies is that the reduction in neurobehavioural performance resulting from sleep loss demonstrated in the laboratory is not an obligatory outcome of reduced sleep in the wild.

The correlation structure (``functional connectivity'') of these fluctuations recapitulates the large-scale functional organization of the brain. However, a unifying physiological account of this structure has so far been lacking. Here, using fMRI in humans, we show that ongoing arousal fluctuations are associated with global waves of activity that slowly propagate in parallel throughout the neocortex, thalamus, striatum, and cerebellum. We show that these waves can parsimoniously account for many features of spontaneous fMRI signal fluctuations, including topographically organized functional connectivity. Last, we demonstrate similar, cortex-wide propagation of neural activity measured with electrocorticography in macaques. These findings suggest that traveling waves spatiotemporally pattern brain-wide excitability in relation to arousal. Traveling waves spatiotemporally organize brain-wide activity in synchrony with ongoing arousal fluctuations.

  abstract = {The pace-of-life syndrome (POLS) hypothesis specifies that closely related species or populations experiencing different ecological conditions should differ in a suite of metabolic, hormonal and immunity traits that have coevolved with the life-history particularities related to these conditions. Surprisingly, two important dimensions of the POLS concept have been neglected: (i) despite increasing evidence for numerous connections between behavioural, physiological and life-history traits, behaviours have rarely been considered in the POLS yet; (ii) the POLS could easily be applied to the study of covariation among traits between individuals within a population. In this paper, we propose that consistent behavioural differences among individuals, or personality, covary with life history and physiological differences at the within-population, interpopulation and interspecific levels. We discuss how the POLS provides a heuristic framework in which personality studies can be integrated to address how variation in personality traits is maintained within populations.},

Mental health cannot be separated from physical health, as evidenced by mental health symptoms and disorders increasing the risk of physical injury and delaying subsequent recovery. There are no evidence or consensus based guidelines for diagnosis and management of mental health symptoms and disorders in elite athletes. Diagnosis must differentiate character traits particular to elite athletes from psychosocial maladaptations. Management strategies should address all contributors to mental health symptoms and consider biopsychosocial factors relevant to athletes to maximise benefit and minimise harm. Management must involve both treatment of affected individual athletes and optimising environments in which all elite athletes train and compete. To advance a more standardised, evidence based approach to mental health symptoms and disorders in elite athletes, an International Olympic Committee Consensus Work Group critically evaluated the current state of science and provided recommendations.},

The fractal and superdiffusive properties of L\'evy walks can be advantageous when searching for randomly and sparsely distributed resources, prompting the suggestion that L\'evy walks represent an evolutionary optimal searching strategy. The suggestion is supported by a plethora of empirical studies which have revealed that many organisms (a diverse range of marine predator, honeybees, Escherichia coli) have movement patterns that can approximated by L\'evy walks. Nonetheless, L\'evy walks with their strange fractal geometry appear alien to biology and their relevance to biology has been hotly debated. Here I describe some of my own recent contributions to L\'evy walk research. This research has sought to identify biologically plausible mechanisms by which organisms can execute L\'evy walks and to demonstrate that these movement patterns have a utility beyond the understanding and prediction of optimal searching patterns. This work has made apparent that L\'evy walks do not stand outside of the now well-established correlated random walk paradigm but are instead natural consequences of it. I also describe some recent advances in L\'evy walk search theory. \textcopyright{} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

When attempting to locate its nest, M. bagoti adopt a stereotypical search pattern. These searches begin at the location where the ant expects to find the nest, and comprise loops that start and end at this location, and are directed in different azimuthal directions. Loop lengths are exponentially distributed when searches are in visually familiar surroundings and are well described by a mixture of two exponentials when searches are in unfamiliar landscapes. The latter approximates a power-law distribution, the hallmark of an L\'evy search. With the aid of a simple analytically tractable theory, we show that an exponential loop-length distribution is advantageous when the distance to the nest can be estimated with some certainty and that a bi-exponential distribution is advantageous when there is considerable uncertainty regarding the nest location. The best bi-exponential search patterns are shown to be those that come closest to approximating advantageous L\'evy looping searches. The bi-exponential search patterns of M. bagoti are found to approximate advantageous L\'evy search patterns. \textcopyright{} 2013.},

Objective: This review appraises the evidence base regarding the mental health and wellbeing of elite-level athletes, including the incidence and/or nature of mental ill-health and substance use. Methods: A systematic search of the PubMed, EMBASE, SPORTDiscus, PsycINFO, Cochrane and Google Scholar databases, up to and including May 2015, was conducted. Results: The search yielded a total of 2279 records. Following double screening, 60 studies were included. The findings suggested that elite athletes experience a broadly comparable risk of high-prevalence mental disorders (i.e. anxiety, depression) relative to the general population. Evidence regarding other mental health domains (i.e. eating disorders, substance use, stress and coping) is less consistent. These results are prefaced, however, by the outcome of the quality assessment of the included studies, which demonstrated that relatively few studies (25~\%) were well reported or methodologically rigorous. Furthermore, there is a lack of intervention-based research on this topic. Conclusion: The evidence base regarding the mental health and wellbeing of elite athletes is limited by a paucity of high-quality, systematic studies. Nonetheless, the research demonstrates that this population is vulnerable to a range of mental health problems (including substance misuse), which may be related to both sporting factors (e.g. injury, overtraining and burnout) and non-sporting factors. More high-quality epidemiological and intervention studies are needed to inform optimal strategies to identify and respond to player mental health needs.},

Because the peripheral and central nervous systems ultimately control behavior, research in neuroecology seeks to link the neural basis of behavior with behavioral control of ecological interactions, and to determine how specific processes (e.g., environmental and genetic constraints, ecological and evolutionary forces) operating to alter nervous system function might constrain or facilitate adaptive behavior. Our goal for this symposium was to promote a general framework for neuroecology by exploring fundamental questions germane to this new area of research, and to develop a "toolbox" of techniques and approaches for addressing those questions. In the following series of papers, we provide a starting point for future work on neuroecology, including evolutionary context, the role of plasticity in shaping nervous system function and behavior, and an exploration of various sensorimotor systems that control ecological interactions. By promoting an integration of observational and experimental approaches at different levels of organization, we can reveal much about how the neural bases of behaviors influence interactions that occur under ecologically relevant contexts that would otherwise be impossible from isolated physiological, behavioral, or ecological components.},

Its columnar organization coupled with the anatomical tracts to and from this region suggests that the CC may supervise various forms of locomotion. In cockroach, lesions of the CC affect turning and controlled climbing over blocks (Ridgel et al., J Comp Physiol A, 193:385-402, 2007). Since these behaviors are largely directed by tactile cues detected by antennae, we predicted that some neurons in the CC respond to mechanical antennal stimulation. We used 16-channel probes to record from broad regions within the CC, while mechanically stimulating one or the other antenna. Using cluster cutting procedures, we examined 277 units in 31 preparations. Many of these units responded to mechanical stimulation of the antennae, and of these, most responded equally well to medial or lateral stimulation of either antenna. However, several units either responded to only one antenna or responded significantly more strongly to one of them. Most of the units responding to antennal stimulation were sensitive to changes in the velocity as well as changes in light. Our data reveal a large population of mult-sensory neurons in the CC that could contribute to locomotion control. \textcopyright{} 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract = {Optic flow, the measure of the speed at which visual input moves past the eye, is a general feature of biological vision. As the performance of the visual system is thought to affect behaviour, we set out to investigate whether self-induced optic flow affects walking behaviour of the wood ant (Formica rufa). Previous investigations of the use of optic flow in walking insects have been performed using freely moving animals, which does not permit full control of the visual experience. To overcome this we developed a novel virtual reality setup, which we validated by testing whether wood ants interact with a black beacon in virtual reality. We found that wood ants preferentially faced the beacon and exhibited aggression towards it. We take this to provide convincing evidence that wood ants interact with and utilise visual information within a virtual reality setup. To study if and how wood ants use self-generated optic flow to control walking behaviour they were placed in a completely white environment with a black pattern on the floor. We show that wood ants respond to decreased gain (x0.3) of self-induced translational optic flow by increasing their walking speed by 29-98\% and increasing their translational walking duration by 34-118\%, whereas neither normal or increased (3x) gain has any effects. We further show that the increased walking duration results both from increasing duration of walking bouts and decreasing duration of pauses. This is the first evidence that wood ants use self-induced optic flow, and the first direct evidence that the sensory experience affects locomotion duration and intermittency in any animal.},

It appears that the two innermost synaptic areas (the lobula and the medulla) constitute the crucial optic lobe elements.

Thresholds were compared to measured vibrations close to anthropogenic operations and to the time in captivity prior to tests. Behaviour varied according to the strength of the stimulus with a significant difference in average threshold values between the two behavioural indicators, although there was an overlap between the two, with overall sensitivity ranging from 0.09\textendash 0.44ms-2 (root mean squared, RMS). Crabs of shortest duration in captivity prior to tests had significantly greater sensitivity to vibration, down to 0.02ms-2 (RMS). The sensitivity of P. bernhardus fell well within the range of vibrations measured near anthropogenic operations. The data indicate that anthropogenic substrate-borne vibrations have a clear effect on the behaviour of a common marine crustacean. The study emphasises that these vibrations are an important component of noise pollution that requires further attention to understand the long term effects on marine crustaceans.},

  abstract = {Forest restoration requires monitoring to assess changes in above- and below-ground communities, which is challenging due to practical and resource limitations. With emerging sound recording technologies, ecological acoustic survey methods\textemdash also known as `ecoacoustics'\textemdash are increasingly available. These provide a rapid, effective, and non-intrusive means of monitoring biodiversity. Above-ground ecoacoustics is increasingly widespread, but soil ecoacoustics has yet to be utilised in restoration despite its demonstrable effectiveness at detecting meso- and macrofauna acoustic signals. This study applied ecoacoustic tools and indices (Acoustic Complexity Index, Normalised Difference Soundscape Index, and Bioacoustic Index) to measure above- and below-ground biodiversity in a forest restoration chronosequence. We hypothesised that higher acoustic complexity, diversity and high-frequency to low-frequency ratio would be detected in restored forest plots. We collected n = 198 below-ground samples and n = 180 ambient and controlled samples from three recently degraded (within 10 years) and three restored (30-51 years ago) deciduous forest plots across three monthly visits. We used passive acoustic monitoring to record above-ground biological sounds and a below-ground sampling device and sound-attenuation chamber to record soil communities. We found that restored plot acoustic complexity and diversity were higher in the sound-attenuation chamber soil but not in situ or above-ground samples. Moreover, we found that restored plots had a significantly greater high-frequency to low-frequency ratio for soil, but no such association for above-ground samples. Our results suggest that ecoacoustics has the potential to monitor below-ground biodiversity, adding to the restoration ecologist's toolkit and supporting global ecosystem recovery. Implications for PracticeThis is the first known study to assess the sounds of soil biodiversity in a forest restoration context, paving the way for more comprehensive studies and practical applications to support global ecosystem recovery.Soil ecoacoustics has the potential to support restoration ecology/biodiversity assessments, providing a minimally intrusive, cost-effective and rapid surveying tool. The methods are also relatively simple to learn and apply.Ecoacoustics can contribute toward overcoming the profound challenge of quantifying the effectiveness (i.e., success) of forest restoration interventions in reinstating target species, functions and so-called `services' and reducing disturbance.},

  abstract = {Animal `personality', defined as repeatable inter-individual differences in behaviour, is a concept in biology that faces intense controversy. Critics argue that the field is riddled with terminological and methodological inconsistencies and lacks a sound theoretical framework. Nevertheless, experimental biologists are increasingly studying individual differences in physiology and relating these to differences in behaviour, which can lead to fascinating insights. We encourage this trend, and in this Commentary we highlight some of the benefits of estimating variation in (and covariation among) phenotypic traits at the inter- and intra-individual levels. We focus on behaviour while drawing parallels with physiological and performance-related traits. First, we outline some of the confusion surrounding the terminology used to describe repeatable inter-individual differences in behaviour. Second, we argue that acknowledging individual behavioural differences can help researchers avoid sampling and experimental bias, increase explanatory power and, ultimately, understand how selection acts on physiological traits. Third, we summarize the latest methods to collect, analyse and present data on individual trait variation. We note that, while measuring the repeatability of phenotypic traits is informative in its own right, it is only the first step towards understanding how natural selection and genetic architecture shape intra-specific variation in complex, labile traits. Thus, understanding how and why behavioural traits evolve requires linking repeatable inter-individual behavioural differences with core aspects of physiology (e.g. neurophysiology, endocrinology, energy metabolism) and evolutionary biology (e.g. selection gradients, heritability).},

  abstract = {The circadian clock of the nocturnal Madeira cockroach is located in the accessory medulla, a small nonretinotopic neuropil in the brain's visual system. The clock comprises about 240 neurons that control rhythms in physiology and behavior such as sleep-wake cycles. The clock neurons contain an abundant number of partly colocalized neuropeptides, among them pigment-dispersing factor (PDF), the insects' most important circadian coupling signal that controls sleep-wake rhythms. We performed long-term loose-patch clamp recordings under 12:12-hr light-dark cycles in the cockroach clock in vivo. A wide range of timescales, from milliseconds to seconds, were found in spike and field potential patterns. We developed a framework of wavelet transform\textendash based methods to detect these multiscale electrical events. We analyzed frequencies and patterns of events with interesting dynamic features, such as mixed-mode oscillations reminiscent of sharp-wave ripples. Oscillations in the beta/gamma frequency range (20\textendash 40 Hz) were observed to rise at dawn, when PDF is released, peaking just before the onset of locomotor activity of the nocturnal cockroach. We expect that in vivo electrophysiological recordings combined with neuropeptide/antagonist applications and behavioral analysis will determine whether specific patterns of electrical activity recorded in the network of the cockroach circadian clock are causally related to neuropeptide-dependent control of behavior.We seek to understand how the neuronal network of the cockroach circadian clock controls temporal rhythms in physiology and behavior. Circadian clocks in mammals and insects alike employ neuropeptides for information processing that bypass synaptic information transfer. Neuropeptides appear to work as coupling factors synchronizing and binding neuronal circuits on multiple timescales, employing schemes of temporal encoding. Expanding known techniques with novel approaches, we describe oscillations of electrical events on multiple timescales in long-term in vivo electrophysiological recordings. In future studies, we will combine experimental approaches with the construction of minimal oscillator networks to examine how the cockroach brain controls sleep-wake cycles based on neuropeptide signaling.},

  abstract = {While foraging, desert ants of the genus Cataglyphis use a vector navigation (route integration) system for homing. Any vector navigation system requires that the animal is able to evaluate the angles steered and the distances travelled. Here we investigate whether the ants acquire the latter information by monitoring self-induced optic flow. To answer this question, the animals were trained and tested within perspex channels in which patterns were presented underneath a transparent walking platform. The patterns could be moved at different velocities (up to {$>$} 0.5 the ant's walking speed) in the same or in the opposite direction relative to the direction in which the animal walked. Experimental manipulations of the optic flow influenced the ant's homing distances (Figs. 2 and 4). Distance estimation depends on the speed of self-induced image motion rather than on the contrast frequency, indicating that the motion sensitive mechanism involved is different from mechanisms mediating the optomotor response. Experiments in which the ants walked on a featureless floor, or in which they wore eye covers (Fig. 6), show that they are able also to use additional (probably kinesthetic) cues for assessing their travel distance. Hence, even though optic flow cues are not the only ones used by the ants, the experiments show that ants are obviously able to exploit such cues for estimation of travel distance. \textcopyright{} 1995 Springer-Verlag.},

The ants were trained to run to a distant food source within a channel whose walls were covered with black-and-white gratings. From the food source, they were transferred to test channels of double or half the training width, and the distance they travelled before searching for home and their walking speeds were recorded. Since the animals experience different motion parallax cues when walking in the broader or narrower channels, the optic-flow hypothesis predicted that the ants would walk faster and further in the broader channels, but more slowly and less far in the narrower channels. In contrast to this expectation, neither the walking speeds nor the searching distances depended on the width or height of the channels or on the pattern wavelengths. Even when ventral-field visual cues were excluded by covering the eyes with light-tight paint, the ants were not influenced by lateral optic flow-field cues. Hence, walking desert ants do not depend on self-induced visual flow-field cues in gauging the distance they have travelled, as do flying honeybees, but can measure locomotor distance exclusively by idiothetic means.},

  abstract = {Malpighian tubules, analogous to vertebrate nephrons, play a key role in insect osmoregulation and detoxification. Tubules can become infected with a protozoan, Malpighamoeba, which damages their epithelial cells, potentially compromising their function. Here we used a modified Ramsay assay to quantify the impact of Malpighamoeba infection on fluid secretion and P-glycoprotein-dependent detoxification by desert locust Malpighian tubules. Infected tubules have a greater surface area and a higher fluid secretion rate than uninfected tubules. Infection also impairs P-glycoprotein-dependent detoxification by reducing the net rhodamine extrusion per surface area. However, due to the increased surface area and fluid secretion rate, infected tubules have similar total net extrusion per tubule to uninfected tubules. Increased fluid secretion rate of infected tubules likely exposes locusts to greater water stress and increased energy costs. Coupled with reduced efficiency of P-glycoprotein detoxification per surface area, Malpighamoeba infection is likely to reduce insect survival in natural environments.},

  abstract = {Sleep and sleep-like states are present across the animal kingdom, with recent studies convincingly demonstrating sleep-like states in arthropods, nematodes, and even cnidarians. However, the existence of different sleep phases across taxa is as yet unclear. In particular, the study of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is still largely centered on terrestrial vertebrates, particularly mammals and birds. The most salient indicator of REM sleep is the movement of eyes during this phase. Movable eyes, however, have evolved only in a limited number of lineages\textemdash an adaptation notably absent in insects and most terrestrial arthropods\textemdash restricting cross-species comparisons. Jumping spiders, however, possess movable retinal tubes to redirect gaze, and in newly emerged spiderlings, these movements can be directly observed through their temporarily translucent exoskeleton. Here, we report evidence for an REM sleep\textendash like state in a terrestrial invertebrate: periodic bouts of retinal movements coupled with limb twitching and stereotyped leg curling behaviors during nocturnal resting in a jumping spider. Observed retinal movement bouts were consistent, including regular durations and intervals, with both increasing over the course of the night. That these characteristic REM sleep\textendash like behaviors exist in a highly visual, long-diverged lineage further challenges our understanding of this sleep state. Comparisons across such long-diverged lineages likely hold important questions and answers about the visual brain as well as the origin, evolution, and function of REM sleep.},

Extrinsic forces include gravity or friction,1,2 whereas intrinsic forces are generated by active muscle contraction or passive musculoskeletal elements.3,4 For lightweight appendages, such as insect limbs, movements depend more upon intrinsic than extrinsic forces.5,6 Indeed, passive movements of insect limbs can be large and oppose or aid joint flexion, extension, or both.4 Yet, how passive properties contribute to insects' goal-directed limb movements, such as targeted reaching and searching,7, 8, 9, 10 remains unclear. Here, we show that mantids make targeted reaches and searches to objects by using their raptorial forelimbs, employing braking to slow passive flexion of the femoro-tibial (FTi) joint. In most reaches, tibial flexion ensures the forelimb contacts the object. Such tibial flexion is particularly clear when the forelimb misses the object and continues on a downward trajectory or during directed searching movements. We characterize the passive properties of the FTi joint by combining passive movements of excised limbs with apodeme ablations and muscle stimulation. These experiments show that passive properties of the flexor tibiae muscle-apodeme complex are the primary structural element producing tibial flexion in excised limbs. During reaching and searching, however, tibial flexion is slower and smaller than predicted. This is due to braking, which opposes passive flexion, thereby reducing the magnitude and velocity of tibial flexion. Braking retarding passive movements is a novel behaviorally relevant control strategy for the goal-directed movements of lightweight limbs, such as those of insects.},

Although curtailed by low adjustment frequency of animals to the test environment, the data obtained from successfully monitoring two animals in constant darkness (DD) and six animals exposed to 12 hour light-dark cycles (LD) revealed a strong effect of light on locomotor activity in P. hirtus. In LD, activity was prevalent during the artificial night phases while close to absent during the presumptive day phases, suggesting conserved nocturnality. Upon transitioning LD animals to constant darkness, none displayed detectable evidence of free-running activity rhythms, suggesting complete regression of the central circadian clock. Equally notable, overall locomotor activity of the two DD-monitored animals was about three-fold lower compared to LD animals due to longer rest durations in the former. We, therefore, propose the existence of cave zone-specific energy expenditure modes that are mediated through light schedule responsive modification of sleep duration in P. hirtus.},

Male laboratory rats (n\,=\,36) were tested in a series of tasks (Open field test, Elevated plus maze test, and modified T-maze test) repeated over time to assess their personality traits. To evaluate the temporal stability of the behaviour, we calculated repeatability estimates of the examined traits. We also checked for a link in behavioural traits across these experiments, which would suggest the existence of a behavioural syndrome. We found stable inter-individual differences in behaviour. Interestingly, no link emerged between the tasks we studied and therefore we did not find support for a behavioural syndrome. The lack of behavioural correlations between these experiments suggests that the results derived from these tasks should be interpreted carefully, as these experiments may measure various behavioural axes. Moreover, the animals habituate to the apparatus. Consequently, behaviour in the Open field test and Elevated plus maze test is not fully consistent and repeatable across subsequent trials.},

For instance, perception is fundamentally limited by the information that the brain can extract from the noisy dynamics of sensory neurons. Seminal experiments2,3 suggest that correlated noise in sensory cortical neural ensembles is what limits their coding accuracy4\textendash 6, although how correlated noise affects neural codes remains debated7\textendash 11. Recent theoretical work proposes that how a neural ensemble's sensory tuning properties relate statistically to its correlated noise patterns is a greater determinant of coding accuracy than is absolute noise strength12\textendash 14. However, without simultaneous recordings from thousands of cortical neurons with shared sensory inputs, it is unknown whether correlated noise limits coding fidelity. Here we present a 16-beam, two-photon microscope to monitor activity across the mouse primary visual cortex, along with analyses to quantify the information conveyed by large neural ensembles. We found that, in the visual cortex, correlated noise constrained signalling for ensembles with 800\textendash 1,300 neurons. Several noise components of the ensemble dynamics grew proportionally to the ensemble size and the encoded visual signals, revealing the predicted information-limiting correlations12\textendash 14. Notably, visual signals were perpendicular to the largest noise mode, which therefore did not limit coding fidelity. The information-limiting noise modes were approximately ten times smaller and concordant with mouse visual acuity15. Therefore, cortical design principles appear to enhance coding accuracy by restricting around 90\% of noise fluctuations to modes that do not limit signalling fidelity, whereas much weaker correlated noise modes inherently bound sensory discrimination.},

Root movements are strictly related to a root decision strategy, which helps plants to survive under stressful conditions by optimizing energy consumption. In this work, we present a novel image-analysis tool to study the kinematics of the root tip (apex), named analyser for root tip tracks (ARTT). The software implementation combines a segmentation algorithm with additional software imaging filters in order to realize a 2D tip detection. The resulting paths, or tracks, arise from the sampled tip positions through the acquired images during the growth. ARTT allows work with no markers and deals autonomously with new emerging root tips, as well as handling a massive number of data relying on minimum user interaction. Consequently, ARTT can be used for a wide range of applications and for the study of kinematics in different plant species. In particular, the study of the root growth and behaviour could lead to the definition of novel principles for the penetration and/or control paradigms for soil exploration and monitoring tasks. The software capabilities were demonstrated by experimental trials performed with Zea mays and Oryza sativa.}

  abstract = {Radio telemetry is an advanced method for studying movement behaviour which is one of the keys to understanding species ecology and biology. Using this method we studied the movement of Carabus ullrichii Germar, 1824, a large and apterous ground beetle species. Four individuals (one male, three females) were equipped with 0.28 g transmitters and radio-tracked for 10 days in three hour intervals in mosaic rural area; meadow and orchard. We found that maximum distance covered by an individual during this period was 120.9 m and C. ullrichii travelling speed in such habitat ranged from 1.69 to 13.43 m per day. Our preliminary results indicate that diurnal activity of this species is not affected by light conditions but by temperature. Beetles were most active at temperatures 15.0\textendash 17.4\textdegree C. Here we provide the first study of the movement ability of this species.},

Characterizing complex vocalizations can require considerable effort and a deep intuition about each species' vocal behavior. Even with a great deal of experience, human characterizations of animal communication can be affected by human perceptual biases. We present a set of computational methods for projecting animal vocalizations into low dimensional latent representational spaces that are directly learned from the spectrograms of vocal signals. We apply these methods to diverse datasets from over 20 species, including humans, bats, songbirds, mice, cetaceans, and nonhuman primates. Latent projections uncover complex features of data in visually intuitive and quantifiable ways, enabling high-powered comparative analyses of vocal acoustics. We introduce methods for analyzing vocalizations as both discrete sequences and as continuous latent variables. Each method can be used to disentangle complex spectro-temporal structure and observe long-timescale organization in communication.},

However, little is known about the electrophysiological responses of the phloem to wounding, and whether natural damaging stimuli induce propagating electrical signals in this tissue. Here, we used living aphids and the direct current (DC) version of the electrical penetration graph (EPG) to detect changes in the membrane potential of Arabidopsis sieve elements (SEs) during caterpillar wounding. Feeding wounds in the lamina induced fast depolarization waves in the affected leaf, rising to maximum amplitude (c. 60 mV) within 2 s. Major damage to the midvein induced fast and slow depolarization waves in unwounded neighbor leaves, but only slow depolarization waves in non-neighbor leaves. The slow depolarization waves rose to maximum amplitude (c. 30 mV) within 14 s. Expression of a jasmonate-responsive gene was detected in leaves in which SEs displayed fast depolarization waves. No electrical signals were detected in SEs of unwounded neighbor leaves of plants with suppressed expression of GLR3.3 and GLR3.6. EPG applied as a novel approach to plant electrophysiology allows cell-specific, robust, real-time monitoring of early electrophysiological responses in plant cells to damage, and is potentially applicable to a broad range of plant-herbivore interactions.},

  abstract = {Slow oscillations are the coordinated activity of large neuronal populations consisting of alternating active (Up states) and silent periods (Down states). These oscillations occur in the corticothalamocortical network during slow-wave sleep and deep anesthesia. They also spontaneously occur in isolated cortical slices or in disconnected `cortical islands' in brain damage. This rhythmic activity emerges in the cortical network when there are no other driving inputs and is considered its default activity pattern. During Up states, neocortical neurons receive barrages of synaptic inputs and fire action potentials. During Down states, neurons remain silent; rather they are hyperpolarized, and synaptic activity is almost nonexistent. From a dynamic perspective, this pattern is often referred to as a state-dependent bistability. During Up states, the activity expresses coherent oscillations at high frequencies in the beta and gamma ranges, sharing properties with wakefulness. The impact of Up/Down states on synaptic transmission and plasticity and its relationship with sleep are discussed.}

This is expressed most clearly in these insects by spontaneous antennal movements which appear at irregular intervals throughout the night and interrupt episodes of antennal immobility. Here we present a newly developed video technique for the continuous recording of the position and movements of the bee's antennae. The same technique was used to record head inclination and ventilatory movements. Despite the constancy of the ambient temperature, the magnitudes of antennae-related parameters, as well as head inclination and ventilatory cycle duration, displayed dynamic unimodal time-courses which exhibited a high degree of temporal covariance. The similarity between these time-courses and the nightly time-course of the reaction threshold for a sensory stimulus, investigated previously, indicates that, in honey bees, deepest "sleep" and least ventilatory activity occur at the same time (in the 7th hour of the rest phase).},

  abstract = {Rest at night in forager honey bees (Apis mellifera) meets essential criteria of sleep. This paper reports the effect of a 12-h total sleep deprivation (SD) by forced activity on the behaviour of these animals. The behaviour of sleep-deprived animals is compared with that of control animals under LD [periodic alternation between light (L) and darkness (D)] 12:12 hours. SD for 12 h during the first D period resulted in a significant difference with respect to the parameter 'hourly amount of antennal immobility' between sleep-deprived and control animals during the remaining L and D periods. This difference did not occur in the L period following the deprivation night, but rather it became obvious at the beginning of the following D period. The increase of the amount of antennal immobility in sleep-deprived bees was accompanied by an increase of the duration of episodes of antennal immobility. Moreover, the latency from 'lights off to the first episode of antennal immobility lasting 20 s or longer ('deep sleep latency') tended to be shorter in sleep-deprived than in control animals. Disturbing the bees during the day (L period) did not result in such differences between disturbed and control animals. Highest reaction thresholds in sleeping honey bees occur during long episodes of antennal immobility. We therefore conclude that honey bees compensate a sleep deficit by intensification (deepening) of the sleep process and thus that sleep in honey bees, like that in other arthropods and mammals, is controlled by regulatory mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Two clock-controlled processes, overt circadian rhythmicity and the photoperiodic induction of diapause, are described in the blow fly,Calliphora vicina and the fruit fly,Drosophila melanogaster. Circadian locomotor rhythms of the adult flies reflect endogenous, self-sustained oscillations with a temperature compensated period. The free-running rhythms become synchronised (entrained) to daily light:dark cycles, but become arrhythmic in constant light above a certain intensity. Some flies show fragmented rhythms (internal desynchronisation) suggesting that overt rhythmicity is the product of a multioscillator (multicellular) system. Photoperiodic induction of larval diapause inC. vicina and of ovarian diapause inD. melanogaster is also based on the circadian system but seems, to involve a separate mechanism at both the molecular and neuronal levels. For both processes in both species, the compound eyes and ocelli are neither essential nor necessary for photic entrainment, and the circadian clock mechanism is not within the optic lobes. The central brain is the most likely site for both rhythm generation and extra-optic photoreception. InD. melanogaster, a group of lateral brain neurons has been identified as important circadian pacemaker cells, which are possibly also photo-sensitive. Similar lateral brain neurons, staining for arrestin, a protein in the phototransduction `cascade' and a selective marker for photoreceptors in both vertebrates and invertebrates, have been identified inC. vicina. Much less is known about the cellular substrate of the photoperiodic mechanism, but this may involve thepars intercerebralis region of the mid-brain.},

Here we compute these measures for spontaneous magnetoencephalographic (MEG) signals from humans during altered states of consciousness induced by three psychedelic substances: Psilocybin, ketamine and LSD. For all three, we find reliably higher spontaneous signal diversity, even when controlling for spectral changes. This increase is most pronounced for the single-channel LZ complexity measure, and hence for temporal, as opposed to spatial, signal diversity. We also uncover selective correlations between changes in signal diversity and phenomenological reports of the intensity of psychedelic experience. This is the first time that these measures have been applied to the psychedelic state and, crucially, that they have yielded values exceeding those of normal waking consciousness. These findings suggest that the sustained occurrence of psychedelic phenomenology constitutes an elevated level of consciousness- A s measured by neural signal diversity.},

  abstract = {1. Linear regression models are an important statistical tool in evolutionary and ecological studies. Unfortunately, these models often yield some uninterpretable estimates and hypothesis tests, especially when models contain interactions or polynomial terms. Furthermore, the standard errors for treatment groups, although often of interest for including in a publication, are not directly available in a standard linear model. 2. Centring and standardization of input variables are simple means to improve the interpretability of regression coefficients. Further, refitting the model with a slightly modified model structure allows extracting the appropriate standard errors for treatment groups directly from the model. 3. Centring will make main effects biologically interpretable even when involved in interactions and thus avoids the potential misinterpretation of main effects. This also applies to the estimation of linear effects in the presence of polynomials. Categorical input variables can also be centred and this sometimes assists interpretation. 4. Standardization (z-transformation) of input variables results in the estimation of standardized slopes or standardized partial regression coefficients. Standardized slopes are comparable in magnitude within models as well as between studies. They have some advantages over partial correlation coefficients and are often the more interesting standardized effect size. 5. The thoughtful removal of intercepts or main effects allows extracting treatment means or treatment slopes and their appropriate standard errors directly from a linear model. This provides a simple alternative to the more complicated calculation of standard errors from contrasts and main effects. 6. The simple methods presented here put the focus on parameter estimation (point estimates as well as confidence intervals) rather than on significance thresholds. They allow fitting complex, but meaningful models that can be concisely presented and interpreted. The presented methods can also be applied to generalised linear models (GLM) and linear mixed models.},

  abstract = {Linear mixed-effects models are powerful tools for analysing complex datasets with repeated or clustered observations, a common data structure in ecology and evolution. Mixed-effects models involve complex fitting procedures and make several assumptions, in particular about the distribution of residual and random effects. Violations of these assumptions are common in real datasets, yet it is not always clear how much these violations matter to accurate and unbiased estimation. Here we address the consequences of violations in distributional assumptions and the impact of missing random effect components on model estimates. In particular, we evaluate the effects of skewed, bimodal and heteroscedastic random effect and residual variances, of missing random effect terms and of correlated fixed effect predictors. We focus on bias and prediction error on estimates of fixed and random effects. Model estimates were usually robust to violations of assumptions, with the exception of slight upward biases in estimates of random effect variance if the generating distribution was bimodal but was modelled by Gaussian error distributions. Further, estimates for (random effect) components that violated distributional assumptions became less precise but remained unbiased. However, this particular problem did not affect other parameters of the model. The same pattern was found for strongly correlated fixed effects, which led to imprecise, but unbiased estimates, with uncertainty estimates reflecting imprecision. Unmodelled sources of random effect variance had predictable effects on variance component estimates. The pattern is best viewed as a cascade of hierarchical grouping factors. Variances trickle down the hierarchy such that missing higher-level random effect variances pool at lower levels and missing lower-level and crossed random effect variances manifest as residual variance. Overall, our results show remarkable robustness of mixed-effects models that should allow researchers to use mixed-effects models even if the distributional assumptions are objectively violated. However, this does not free researchers from careful evaluation of the model. Estimates that are based on data that show clear violations of key assumptions should be treated with caution because individual datasets might give highly imprecise estimates, even if they will be unbiased on average across datasets.},

We used a multilevel experimental approach to assess whether circadian rhythms modulate several aspects of the visual physiology and behavior of the praying mantis Hierodula patellifera. We used electroretinograms (ERGs) to assess compound eye sensitivity, colorimetric photographic analyses to assess compound eye color changes (screening pigment migration), behavioral assays of responsiveness to computer-generated prey-like visual stimuli and analyses of locomotor activity patterns on a modified treadmill apparatus. Our results indicate that circadian clocks control and/or modulate each of the target behaviors. Strong rhythms, persisting under constant conditions, with periods of \textasciitilde 24 h were evident in photoreceptor sensitivity to light, appetitive responsiveness to prey-like stimuli and gross locomotor activity. In the first two cases, responsiveness was highest during the subjective night and lowest during the subjective day. Locomotor activity was strongly clustered around the transition time from day to night. In addition, pigment migration and locomotor behavior responded strongly to light:dark cycles and anticipated the light-dark transition, suggesting that the circadian clocks modulating both were entrained to environmental light cues. Together, these data indicate that circadian rhythms operate at the cellular, cellular systems and organismal level in H. patellifera. Our results represent an intriguing first step in uncovering the complexities of circadian rhythms in the Mantodea.},

  abstract = {A sensitivity of the circadian clock to light/dark cycles ensures that biological rhythms maintain optimal phase relationships with the external day. In animals, the circadian clock neuron network (CCNN) driving sleep/activity rhythms receives light input from multiple photoreceptors, but how these photoreceptors modulate CCNN components is not well understood. Here we show that the Hofbauer-Buchner eyelets differentially modulate two classes of ventral lateral neurons (LNvs) within the Drosophila CCNN. The eyelets antagonize Cryptochrome (CRY)- and compound-eye-based photoreception in the large LNvs while synergizing CRY-mediated photoreception in the small LNvs. Furthermore, we show that the large LNvs interact with subsets of ``evening cells'' to adjust the timing of the evening peak of activity in a day length-dependent manner. Our work identifies a peptidergic connection between the large LNvs and a group of evening cells that is critical for the seasonal adjustment of circadian rhythms. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT In animals, circadian clocks have evolved to orchestrate the timing of behavior and metabolism. Consistent timing requires the entrainment these clocks to the solar day, a process that is critical for an organism's health. Light cycles are the most important external cue for the entrainment of circadian clocks, and the circadian system uses multiple photoreceptors to link timekeeping to the light/dark cycle. How light information from these photorecptors is integrated into the circadian clock neuron network to support entrainment is not understood. Our results establish that input from the HB eyelets differentially impacts the physiology of neuronal subgroups. This input pathway, together with input from the compound eyes, precisely times the activity of flies under long summer days. Our results provide a mechanistic model of light transduction and integration into the circadian system, identifying new and unexpected network motifs within the circadian clock neuron network.},

  abstract = {The energy allocation (EA) model defines behavioral strategies that optimize the temporal utilization of energy to maximize reproductive success. This model proposes that all species of the animal kingdom share a universal sleep function that shunts waking energy utilization toward sleep-dependent biological investment. For endotherms, REM sleep evolved to enhance energy appropriation for somatic and CNS-related processes by eliminating thermoregulatory defenses and skeletal muscle tone. Alternating REM with NREM sleep conserves energy by decreasing the need for core body temperature defense. Three EA phenotypes are proposed: sleep\textendash wake cycling, torpor, and continuous (or predominant) wakefulness. Each phenotype carries inherent costs and benefits. Sleep\textendash wake cycling downregulates specific biological processes in waking and upregulates them in sleep, thereby decreasing energy demands imposed by wakefulness, reducing cellular infrastructure requirements, and resulting in overall energy conservation. Torpor achieves the greatest energy savings, but critical biological operations are compromised. Continuous wakefulness maximizes niche exploitation, but endures the greatest energy demands. The EA model advances a new construct for understanding sleep\textendash wake organization in ontogenetic and phylogenetic domains.},

As our ability to record large neural and behavioural data increases, there is growing interest in modelling neural dynamics during adaptive behaviours to probe neural representations1\textendash 3. In particular, although neural latent embeddings can reveal underlying correlates of behaviour, we lack nonlinear techniques that can explicitly and flexibly leverage joint behaviour and neural data to uncover neural dynamics3\textendash 5. Here, we fill this gap with a new encoding method, CEBRA, that jointly uses behavioural and neural data in a (supervised) hypothesis- or (self-supervised) discovery-driven manner to produce both consistent and high-performance latent spaces. We show that consistency can be used as a metric for uncovering meaningful differences, and the inferred latents can be used for decoding. We validate its accuracy and demonstrate our tool's utility for both calcium and electrophysiology datasets, across sensory and motor tasks and in simple or complex behaviours across species. It allows leverage of single- and multi-session datasets for hypothesis testing or can be used label free. Lastly, we show that CEBRA can be used for the mapping of space, uncovering complex kinematic features, for the production of consistent latent spaces across two-photon and Neuropixels data, and can provide rapid, high-accuracy decoding of natural videos from visual cortex.},

When the substrate moved in, or the pattern against the bee's direction, thus increasing PFS, WS decreased and the bees preferred the nearer exit.

  abstract = {Background Urbanization leads to substantial changes in natural habitats with profound effects on wildlife. Understanding behavioural responses to such environmental change is essential for identifying which organisms may adapt, as behaviour is often the first response to altered conditions. Individuals in more urbanized habitats may be expected to be more exploratory and bolder than their conspecifics in less urbanized habitats as they may be better able to cope with novel challenges. Methods In a two-year field study we tested ground beetles from differently urbanized forests for their exploratory behaviour (in a novel environment) and their risk-taking (death-feigning). In total, we tested ca. 3,000 individuals of four forest-dwelling ground beetle species from eight within-city forest patches. In the second year, we also transferred ca. 800 tested individuals of two species to the laboratory to test for consistent behavioural differences (i.e. personality differences) under standardised conditions. Results Individuals were generally more exploratory in more urbanized than in less urbanized areas but only in one year of the study. Exploratory behaviour was not predicted by population density but increased with temperature or showed a temperature optimum. Exploration was consistent over time and individuals that were more exploratory also took higher risks. Discussion We demonstrated that species which are generally less directly exposed to human activities (e.g., most invertebrates) show behavioural responses to urbanization. Effects of urbanization were year-dependent, suggesting that other environmental conditions interacted with effects of urbanization on beetle behaviour. Furthermore, our results indicate that different personality compositions might cause behavioural differences among populations living in differently urbanized habitats.},

The variations covered 2 frequency bands within the range of 0.4 Hz to 1.2 Hz. Periodical variations of spike rate were present when no visible antennal movements occurred and also when accompanied by spontaneous antennal twitches or during swaying movement of the antennae. Swaying movements took place at the end of short antennal movement episodes with a frequency that corresponded to the periodical variations in spike rate. Thus, there may be a relation between episodes of antennal movements and rhythmic spike activity recorded in the mushroom bodies during episodes of antennal immobility.},

The neural population encodes the fly's azimuth relative to its environment, tracking visual landmarks when available and relying on self-motion cues in darkness. When both visual and self-motion cues are absent, a representation of the animal's orientation is maintained in this network through persistent activity, a potential substrate for short-term memory. Several features of the population dynamics of these neurons and their circular anatomical arrangement are suggestive of ring attractors, network structures that have been proposed to support the function of navigational brain circuits.},

For instance, the metrics currently used for evaluating pose tracking algorithms use noisy hand-labeled ground truth data and do not prioritize precision of relevant variables like three-dimensional position, velocity, acceleration, and forces which are crucial for movement science. Here, we introduce the scientific disciplines that use movement data, the types of data they need, and discuss the changes needed to make pose tracking truly transformative for movement science.},

Maximal load-carrying ability scaled isometrically with body size, indicating that larger ants had the capacity to lift the same proportion of their body mass as smaller ants (8.78~times body mass). However, larger ants were captured carrying leaf fragments that represented a lower proportion of their body mass compared with their smaller counterparts. Therefore, when selecting leaves, larger ants retained a higher proportion of their load-carrying capacity in reserve. This suggests that either larger ants require greater power reserves to overcome challenges they encounter along the trail or leaf-cutter ants do not select loads that maximize the overall leaf transport rate of the colony.},

One example is learning to accommodate to the refraction of light in water when reaching for objects viewed through a diving mask. In the microgravity environment, somatosensory and vestibular inputs are quite different than they are on Earth. The body is unloaded, resulting in greater movement per unit of force. Moreover, on Earth the otoliths of the vestibular system signal angle of orientation of the head relative to a gravitational vector, which is absent in space. There is a resulting reinterpretation of head tilt as a linear acceleration which leads to motor control and perceptual disruptions on return to Earth. It is perhaps not surprising then that crewmembers report a high incidence of space motion sickness due to sensory conflict. In addition, once individuals adapt movement control for the microgravity environment, these new control processes and strategies are maladaptive for Earth's gravitational field.

  abstract = {Flying insects are able to fly smartly in an unpredictable environment. It has been found that flying insects have smart neurons inside their tiny brains that are sensitive to visual motion also called optic flow. Consequently, flying insects rely mainly on visual motion during their flight maneuvers such as: takeoff or landing, terrain following, tunnel crossing, lateral and frontal obstacle avoidance, and adjusting flight speed in a cluttered environment. Optic flow can be defined as the vector field of the apparent motion of objects, surfaces, and edges in a visual scene generated by the relative motion between an observer (an eye or a camera) and the scene. Translational optic flow is particularly interesting for short-range navigation because it depends on the ratio between (i) the relative linear speed of the visual scene with respect to the observer and (ii) the distance of the observer from obstacles in the surrounding environment without any direct measurement of either speed or distance. In flying insects, roll stabilization reflex and yaw saccades attenuate any rotation at the eye level in roll and yaw respectively (i.e. to cancel any rotational optic flow) in order to ensure pure translational optic flow between two successive saccades. Our survey focuses on feedback-loops which use the translational optic flow that insects employ for collision-free navigation. Optic flow is likely, over the next decade to be one of the most important visual cues that can explain flying insects' behaviors for short-range navigation maneuvers in complex tunnels. Conversely, the biorobotic approach can therefore help to develop innovative flight control systems for flying robots with the aim of mimicking flying insects' abilities and better understanding their flight.},

In this article, we distinguish key aspects of consciousness that are amenable to quantitative measurement from those that are not. We carry out a formal analysis of the strengths and limitations of three quantitative measures of dynamical complexity in the neural systems underlying consciousness: neural complexity, information integration, and causal density. We find that no single measure fully captures the multidimensional complexity of these systems, and all of these measures have practical limitations. Our analysis suggests guidelines for the specification of alternative measures which, in combination, may improve the quantitative characterization of conscious neural systems. Given that some aspects of consciousness are likely to resist quantification altogether, we conclude that a satisfactory theory is likely to be one that combines both qualitative and quantitative elements. \textcopyright{} 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

  abstract = {Background: Extended wakefulness disrupts acquisition of short-term memories in mammals. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms triggered by extended waking and restored by sleep are unknown. Moreover, the neuronal circuits that depend on sleep for optimal learning remain unidentified. Results: Learning was evaluated with aversive phototaxic suppression. In this task, flies learn to avoid light that is paired with an aversive stimulus (quinine-humidity). We demonstrate extensive homology in sleep-deprivation-induced learning impairment between flies and humans. Both 6 hr and 12 hr of sleep deprivation are sufficient to impair learning in Canton-S (Cs) flies. Moreover, learning is impaired at the end of the normal waking day in direct correlation with time spent awake. Mechanistic studies indicate that this task requires intact mushroom bodies (MBs) and requires the dopamine D1-like receptor (dDA1). Importantly, sleep-deprivation-induced learning impairments could be rescued by targeted gene expression of the dDA1 receptor to the MBs. Conclusions: These data provide direct evidence that extended wakefulness disrupts learning in Drosophila. These results demonstrate that it is possible to prevent the effects of sleep deprivation by targeting a single neuronal structure and identify cellular and molecular targets adversely affected by extended waking in a genetically tractable model organism. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {A mechanical model is proposed which quantitatively describes the dynamics of the centre of gravity (c.g.) during the take-off phase of the long jump. The model entails a minimal but necessary number of components: a linear leg spring with the ability of lengthening to describe the active peak of the force time curve and a distal mass coupled with nonlinear visco-elastic elements to describe the passive peak. The influence of the positions and velocities of the supported body and the jumper's leg as well as of systemic parameters such as leg stiffness and mass distribution on the jumping distance were investigated. Techniques for optimum operation are identified: (1) There is a minimum stiffness for optimum performance. Further increase of the stiffness does not lead to longer jumps. (2) For any given stiffness there is always an optimum angle of attack. (3) The same distance can be achieved by different techniques. (4) The losses due to deceleration of the supporting leg do not result in reduced jumping distance as this deceleration results in a higher vertical momentum. (5) Thus, increasing the touch-down velocity of the jumper's supporting leg increases jumping distance. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.},

A more realistic representation of the muscle and tendon properties than implemented previously was necessary to demonstrate the advantages of eccentric force enhancement and non-linear tendon properties. During the take-off phase of the long jump, highly stretched leg extensor muscles are able to generate the required vertical momentum. Thereby, serially arranged elastic structures may increase the duration of muscle lengthening and dissipative operation, resulting in an enhanced force generation of the muscle-tendon complex. To obtain maximum performance, athletes run at maximum speed and have a net loss in mechanical energy during the take-off phase. The positive work done by the concentrically operating muscle is clearly less than the work done by the surrounding system on the muscle during the eccentric phase. Jumping performance was insensitive to changes in tendon compliance and muscle speed, but was greatly influenced by muscle strength and eccentric force enhancement. In agreement with a variety of experimental jumping performances, the optimal jumping technique (angle of attack) was insensitive to the approach speed and to muscle properties (muscle mass, the ratio of muscle fibre to tendon cross-sectional area, relative length of fibres and tendon). The muscle properties also restrict the predicted range of the angle of the velocity vector at take-off.},

We examine how the life history of Drosophila melanogaster, the most commonly used organism for laboratory studies of evolution, evolves in response to two common methods of laboratory culture: in bottles and in population cages. We collected flies at the same site in nature at the same time of year in three consecutive years and compared freshly collected populations from the third collection with the products of 1 or 2 yr's laboratory culture, in a replicated experimental design. Preadult development time increased in the laboratory, particularly in cage culture. There was also an increase in larval competitive ability in both types of culture. Body size was little affected, increasing slightly and only in the bottle culture. Early fecundity increased in bottle culture, while late fecundity declined. Adult mortality rates were lowest in the fresh collections and showed a marked and progressive increase in bottle culture with a slight increase in population cage culture and apparently only in the first year of culture. Remating frequency increased in bottle but not cage culture. These evolutionary changes are most likely explained by increased larval competition in laboratory culture, especially in population cages, and by truncation of the adult period in the bottle culture, resulting in natural selection acting solely on the early part of the adult period.},

  abstract = {The recent development of various methods of modulation such as PCM and PPM which exchange bandwidth for signal-to-noise ratio has intensified the interest in a general theory of communication. A basis for such a theory is contained in the important papers of Nyquist and Hartley on this subject. In the present paper we will extend the theory to include a number of new factors, in particular the effect of noise in the channel, and the savings possible due to the statistical structure of the original message and due to the nature of the final destination of the information. The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point. Frequently the messages have meaning; that is they refer to or are correlated according to some system with certain physical or conceptual entities. These semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem. The significant aspect is that the actual message is one selected from a set of possible messages. The system must be designed to operate for each possible selection, not just the one which will actually be chosen since this is unknown at the time of design. If the number of messages in the set is finite then this number or any monotonic function of this number can be regarded as a measure of the information produced when one message is chosen from the set, all choices being equally likely. As was pointed out by Hartley the most natural choice is the logarithmic function. Although this definition must be generalized considerably when we consider the influence of the statistics of the message and when we have a continuous range of messages, we will in all cases use an essentially logarithmic measure.},

Thus, quiescent episodes are characterized by reduced awareness of the environment and are homeostatically regulated. Although this field is in its infancy, recent studies have focused on the interaction between circadian and homeostatic processes. These results indicate that components of the circadian clock may play a substantial role in mechanisms underlying sleep homeostasis at the molecular level.

Yet the electrophysiological characteristics of brain sleep, such as slow-wave (SW) and rapid eye movement (REM) activities, are thought to be restricted to mammals and birds. Recording from the brain of a lizard, the Australian dragon Pogona vitticeps, we identified SW and REM sleep patterns, thus pushing back the probable evolution of these dynamics at least to the emergence of amniotes. The SW and REM sleep patterns that we observed in lizards oscillated continuously for 6 to 10 hours with a period of 80 seconds. The networks controlling SW-REM antagonism in amniotes may thus originate from a common, ancient oscillator circuit. Lizard SW dynamics closely resemble those observed in rodent hippocampal CA1, yet they originate from a brain area, the dorsal ventricular ridge, that has no obvious hodological similarity with the mammalian hippocampus.},

  abstract = {Neuroecology is the study of adaptive variation in cognition and the brain. The origin of neuroecology dates from the 1980s, when researchers in behavioral ecology began to apply the methods of comparative evolutionary biology to cognitive processes and the underlying neural mechanisms of cognition. The comparative approach, however, is much older. It was a mainstay of ethology, it has been part of the study of neuroanatomy since the seventeenth century, and it was used by Darwin to marshal evidence for the theory of natural selection. Neuroecology examines the relations between ecological selection pressures and species or sex differences in cognition and the brain. The goal of neuroecology is to understand how natural selection acts on cognition and its neural mechanisms. This chapter describes the general approach of neuroecology, phylogenetic comparative methods used in the field, and new findings on the cognitive mechanisms and brain structures involved in mating systems, social organization, communication, and foraging. The contribution of neuroecology to psychology and the neurosciences is the information it provides on the selective pressures that have influenced the evolution of cognition and brain structure.},

The measurement method is very simple. An experimental animal is placed on top of the sphere. The position and heading angle of the animal are observed by using a high-speed camera installed above the sphere. Because the system can rotate the sphere with three degrees of freedom (DOFs) independently, the position and heading angle at the origin can be maintained without fixing the body. This system can be used to measure an animal's natural behavior while simultaneously providing it with precise stimuli. Moreover, electrodes can be inserted at specific sites to measure biosignals with locomotion. Therefore, this system can simultaneously measure the stimulus input-internal state-locomotion output of an animal. In this study, we focused on the chemical plume tracing (CPT) behavior of the Bombyx mori male silkworm moth in order to identify its CPT algorithm for mounting on a robot. In an experiment, we simultaneously measured the stimulus input, flight muscle electromyogram (EMG), and CPT behavior by using the 3-DOF servosphere to verify the system. We elucidated the relationship between the CPT behavior and flight muscle EMG.},

  abstract = {Locusts can learn associations between olfactory stimuli and food rewards, and use the acquired memories to choose between foods according to their nutrient requirements. They are a model system for both the study of olfactory coding and insect nutritional regulation. Previous studies have used operant paradigms for conditioning freely moving locusts, restricting the study of the neural mechanisms underlying the acquisition of olfactory memories, which requires restrained preparations for electrophysiological recordings. Here we present two complementary paradigms for the classical conditioning of olfactory memories in restrained desert locusts (Schistocerca gregaria). These paradigms allow precise experimental control over the parameters influencing learning. The first paradigm is based on classical (Pavlovian) appetitive conditioning. We show that opening of the maxillary palps can be used as a measure of memory acquisition. Maxillary palp opening in response to odour presentation is significantly higher in locusts trained with paired presentation of an odour and a food reward than in locusts trained either with unpaired presentation of food and odour or the odour alone. The memory formed by this conditioning paradigm lasts for at least 24 h. In the second paradigm, we show that classical conditioning of an odour memory in restrained locusts influences their decisions in a subsequent operant task. When locusts that have been trained to associate an odour with a food reward are placed in a Y-maze, they choose the arm containing that odour significantly more often than na\"ive locusts. A single conditioning trial is sufficient to induce a significant bias for that odour for up to 4 h. Multiple- and block-trial training induce a significant bias that lasts at least 24 h. Thus, locusts are capable of forming appetitive olfactory memories in classical conditioning paradigms and can use these memories to modify their decisions.},

  abstract = {Avoiding food that contains toxins is crucial for the survival of many animals, particularly herbivores, because many plants defend themselves with toxins. Some animals can learn to avoid food containing toxins not through its taste but by the toxins' effects following ingestion, though how they do so remains unclear. We studied how desert locusts (Schistocerca gregaria), which are generalist herbivores, form post-ingestive aversive memories and use them to make appropriate olfactory-based decisions in a Y-maze. Locusts form an aversion gradually to an odour paired with food containing the toxin nicotine hydrogen tartrate (NHT), suggesting the involvement of a long-latency associative mechanism. Pairing of odour and toxin-free food accompanied by NHT injections at different latencies showed that locusts could form an association between an odour and toxic malaise, which could be separated by up to 30 min. Tasting but not swallowing the food, or the temporal separation of odour and food, prevents the formation of these long-latency associations, showing that they are post-ingestive. A second associative mechanism not contingent upon feeding operates only when odour presentation is simultaneous with NHT injection. Post-ingestive memory formation is not disrupted by exposure to a novel odour alone but can be if the odour is accompanied by simultaneous NHT injection. Thus, the timing with which food, odour and toxin are encountered whilst foraging is likely to influence memory formation and subsequent foraging decisions. Therefore, locusts can form specific long-lasting aversive olfactory associations that they can use to avoid toxin-containing foods whilst foraging.},

This unique quality of LKM makes it a desirable candidate for buffering the stress of being social evaluated or socially excluded. Using the Trier Social Stress Test and the Cyberball social exclusion paradigm, the present study investigated the effectiveness of a brief LKM session in buffering against social evaluative and social exclusion stress. Three specific questions were addressed: In what domains can LKM exert positive effects? For whom does it work? And, how does it work? One hundred and thirteen participants (N = 113, 49 men) were randomly assigned to either a 10-minute LKM session or a 10-minute visualization control session. Findings showed that even just 10 minutes of LKM had an immediate relaxing effect as evidenced by increased respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), an index of parasympathetic cardiac control, and decreased respiration rate. In addition, the brief LKM intervention led to greater implicit positivity towards the self relative to the control intervention (p = .052). The brief LKM intervention also protected against some of the negative physiological and psychological effects of social stress. The majority of these effects are moderated by trait social anxiety and pre-meditation mood states (or pre-meditation mood state alone). Contrary to expectation, trait social anxiety alone did not moderate any of the LKM effects. Importantly, receiving a brief session of LKM while not being in a positive mood or being in a negative mood led to iatrogenic physiological and psychological effects. Providing an explanation for one of LKM's effects, findings showed that change in RSA during LKM fully mediated the LKM Intervention x Positive Affect interaction effect on change in post-social-stress RSA. In conclusion, findings of the present study have extended our understanding of LKM and have specific implications for future research and practice.}

However, the identity of MB neurons underlying homeostatic sleep regulation, as well as the types of sleep signals generated by specific classes of MB neurons, has remained poorly understood. We recently identified two MB output neuron (MBON) classes whose axons convey sleep control signals from the MB to converge in the same downstream target region: a cholinergic sleep-promoting MBON class and a glutamatergic wake-promoting MBON class. Here, we deploy a combination of neurogenetic, behavioral, and physiological approaches to identify and mechanistically dissect sleep-controlling circuits of the MB. Our studies reveal the existence of two segregated excitatory synaptic microcircuits that propagate homeostatic sleep information from different populations of intrinsic MB "Kenyon cells" (KCs) to specific sleep-regulating MBONs: sleep-promoting KCs increase sleep by preferentially activating the cholinergic MBONs, while wake-promoting KCs decrease sleep by preferentially activating the glutamatergic MBONs. Importantly, activity of the sleep-promoting MB microcircuit is increased by sleep deprivation and is necessary for homeostatic rebound sleep (i.e., the increased sleep that occurs after, and in compensation for, sleep lost during deprivation). These studies reveal for the first time specific functional connections between subsets of KCs and particular MBONs and establish the identity of synaptic microcircuits underlying transmission of homeostatic sleep signals in the MB.},

They can arise either from low-level sinusoidal oscillations of the membrane potential or from a linear slow depolarization which accelerates into a rapid upstroke at a voltage 5\textendash 20 mV depolarized from the normal resting potential (near - 180 mV). The ``action potentiais'' are long-lasting, 1\textendash 2 min and at the peak reach a membrane potential near -40 mV. A 2- to 8-fold increase of membrane conductance accompanies the main depolarization, but a slight decrease of membrane conductance occurs during the slow depolarization. Two plausible mechanisms for the phenomenon are (a) periodic increases of membrane permeability to inorganic ions, particularly H+ or Cl- and (b) periodic decreases in activity of the major electrogenic pump (H+) of the Neurospora membrane, coupled with a nonlinear (inverse sigmoid) current-voltage relationship. Identification of action potential-like disturbances in fungi means that such behavior has now been found in all major biologic taxa which have been probed with suitable electrodes.

Contrary to  most classical experiments focused on aggressive interactions, we  assessed workers' speed as a crucial factor in the outcome of  co-occurrence. Generally, there was a large intraspecific variation in  the speed of the studied specieseach had slow and fast individuals.  Workers of all studied species moved faster just after interaction,  suggesting that contact between 2 hostile workers is a stressful  stimulus, generating a behavioral reaction of increasing speed. Also,  the number of aggressive contacts experienced by a given individual  positively affected its speed. Moreover, workers which were fast when  exploring territory were also fast after interspecific interactions. The  duration of aggression was significantly reduced by the speed and body  size of a subordinate species workerthe more quickly a worker reacted  and bigger it was, the shorter was the time of cumulative aggression. To  our knowledge, this is the first study of this type to be conducted on  ants and we conclude that speed is an overlooked and important  characteristic of species and also individuals, therefore it should be  considered as a driver of patterns of co-occurrence in ant assemblages.},

One process responds weakly to error but retains information well, whereas the other responds strongly but has poor retention. This two-state learning system makes the surprising prediction of spontaneous recovery (or adaptation rebound) if error feedback is clamped at zero following an adaptation-extinction training episode. We used a novel paradigm to experimentally confirm this prediction in human motor learning of reaching, and we show that the interaction between the learning processes in this simple two-state system provides a unifying explanation for several different, apparently unrelated, phenomena in motor adaptation including savings, anterograde interference, spontaneous recovery, and rapid unlearning. Our results suggest that motor adaptation depends on at least two distinct neural systems that have different sensitivity to error and retain information at different rates.},

As the private space sector enables more widely available payloads for researchers, it is increasingly necessary to design experimental modules innovatively so that they are proportionately accessible. To ease this bottleneck, we developed a rapid fabrication methodology for producing custom modules compatible with commercial payload slots. Our method creates a unified housing geometry, based on a given component layout, which is fabricated in a digital design and subtractive manufacturing process from a single lightweight foam material. This module design demonstrated a 25\textendash 50\% reduction in chassis weight compared with existing models, and is extremely competitive in manufacturing time, simplicity, and cost. To demonstrate the ability to capture data on previously limited areas of space biology, we apply this methodology to create an autonomous, video-enabled module for sensing and observing queen and retinue bees aboard the Blue Origin New Shepard 11 (NS-11) suborbital flight. To explore whether spaceflight impacts queen fitness, results used high-definition visual data enabled by the module's compact build to analyze queen-worker regulation under microgravity stress (n = 2, with controls).

Wallace (1959) first proposed that this behavior is performed in order to obtain depth information through motion parallax. The present study analyzes more quantitatively the role of peering in the locust's (Schistocerca americana) estimation of distance in an attempt to understand the neural mechanisms involved. 2. Jump velocity was found to be related monotonically to target distance and was used as a measure of the locust's judgement of target distance. 3. By presenting locusts with a target which moved laterally while they peered (artificial parallax), it was possible to simulate the motion parallax of a target at any distance. Jump velocities elicited by means of artificial parallax were the same as jump velocities elicited by the corresponding real distances, demonstrating that locusts use motion parallax as a cue to distance. 4. By moving the target in the same direction but further than the locust's head it was possible to simulate targets whose motion parallax specified a position behind the animal. Locusts jump forward to such paradoxical stimuli with the jump velocity appropriate for targets located at the absolute value of the simulated distance. This suggests that locusts are insensitive to the relation between the direction of head and image motion. 5. Measurement of jump velocity in locusts with one eye occluded revealed an interaction between the parallax signals from the two eyes - locusts appear to sum (or average) the motion perceived in each eye. 6. Jump velocity is predicted more accurately by target distance than by either image displacement or image velocity during peering. This implies that the locust's computation of target distance involves signals concerning its own head motion.},

We trained ants to forage at different distances in linear channels comprising a nest entrance and a feeder. For testing we caught ants at the feeder and released them in a parallel channel. The results show that ants tend to underestimate their distances travelled. This underestimation is the more pronounced, the larger the foraging distance gets. The quantitative relationship between training distance and the ant's estimate of this distance can be described by a logarithmic and an exponential model. The ant's odometric undershooting could be adaptive during natural foraging trips insofar as it leads the homing ant to concentrate the major part of its nest-search behaviour on the base of its individual foraging sector, i.e. on its familiar landmark corridor.},

To investigate the basis of this ``centering response, '' bees were trained to fly through a tunnel on their way to a feeding site and back, while their flight trajectories were filmed from above. The wall on either side carried a visual pattern. When the patterns were stationary vertical gratings, bees tended to fly through the middle of the tunnel, i.e. along its longitudinal axis. However, when one of the gratings was in motion, bees flying in the same direction as the moving grating tended to fly closer to it, while bees flying in the opposite direction tended to fly closer to the stationary grating. This demonstrates, directly and unequivocally, that flying bees estimate the distances of surfaces in terms of the apparent motion of their images. A series of further experiments revealed that the distance to the gratings is gauged in terms of their apparent angular speeds, and that the visual system of the bee is capable of measuring angular speed largely independently of the spatial period, intensity profile, or contrast of the grating. Thus, the motion-sensitive mechanisms mediating range perception appear to be qualitatively different from those that mediate the well-known optomotor response in insects, or those involved in motion detection and ocular tracking in man. \textcopyright{} 1991, Cambridge University Press.

The distance flown to a food source is gauged by integrating the apparent motion of the visual world that is experienced en route. In other words, bees possess a visually driven 'odometer' that is robust to variations in wind load and energy expenditure. Bees flying through a tunnel maintain equidistance to the flanking walls by balancing the apparent speeds of the images of the walls. This strategy enables them to negotiate narrow passages or to fly between obstacles. The speed of flight in a tunnel is controlled by holding constant the average image velocity as seen by the two eyes. This avoids potential collisions by ensuring that the bee slows down when flying through narrow passages. Bees landing on a horizontal surface hold constant the image velocity of the surface as they approach it. This automatically ensures that flight speed decreases with altitude and is close to zero at touchdown. The movement-sensitive mechanisms underlying these various behaviours seem to be different, qualitatively as well as quantitatively, from those mediating the well-investigated optomotor response.},

The results show that the honeybee's 'odometer' is visually driven. They also provide a calibration of the dance and the odometer in visual terms.},

  abstract = {Honeybees navigate to a food source using a sky-based compass to determine their travel direction, and an odometer to register how far they have travelled. The past 20 years have seen a renewed interest in understanding the nature of the odometer. Early work, pioneered by von Frisch and colleagues, hypothesized that travel distance is measured in terms of the energy that is consumed during the journey. More recent studies suggest that visual cues play a role as well. Specifically, bees appear to gauge travel distance by sensing the extent to which the image of the environment moves in the eye during the journey from the hive to the food source. Most of the evidence indicates that travel distance is measured during the outbound journey. Accumulation of odometric errors is restricted by resetting the odometer every time a prominent landmark is passed. When making detours around large obstacles, the odometer registers the total distance of the path that is flown to the destination, and not the "bee-line" distance. Finally, recent studies are revealing that bees can perform odometry in three dimensions.},

  abstract = {Dysregulation of sleep is associated with metabolic diseases, and metabolic rate (MR) is acutely regulated by sleep-wake behavior. In humans and rodent models, sleep loss is associated with obesity, reduced metabolic rate, and negative energy balance, yet little is known about the neural mechanisms governing interactions between sleep and metabolism.We have developed a system to simultaneously measure sleep and MR in individual Drosophila, allowing for interrogation of neural systems governing interactions between sleep and metabolic rate.Like mammals, MR in flies is reduced during sleep and increased during sleep deprivation suggesting sleep-dependent regulation of MR is conserved across phyla. The reduction of MR during sleep is not simply a consequence of inactivity because MR is reduced \textasciitilde 30 minutes following the onset of sleep, raising the possibility that CO2 production provides a metric to distinguish different sleep states in the fruit fly. To examine the relationship between sleep and metabolism, we determined basal and sleep-dependent changes in MR is reduced in starved flies, suggesting that starvation inhibits normal sleep-associated effects on metabolic rate. Further, translin mutant flies that fail to suppress sleep during starvation demonstrate a lower basal metabolic rate, but this rate was further reduced in response to starvation, revealing that regulation of starvation-induced changes in MR and sleep duration are genetically distinct.Therefore, this system provides the unique ability to simultaneously measure sleep and oxidative metabolism, providing novel insight into the physiological changes associated with sleep and wakefulness in the fruit fly.},

  abstract = {When an individual is repeatedly observed or tested in the same context, it does not always express the same behaviour. Intraindividual variability (IIV) refers to the short-term, unpredictable, reversible variation in behaviour that often occurs in this situation. Although individual differences in IIV have been well documented in humans, this topic has been virtually ignored by researchers studying other animals. Here, we review evidence from humans and animals that IIV can vary in important ways across individuals (e.g. as a function of age or prior experience) and that individual differences in IIV may be related to differences in performance. However, most statistical models currently used to study individual differences in behaviour in animals rely on the assumption that IIV does not vary across individuals. Using `boldness' data for hermit crabs, Pagurus bernhardus, and Ward's damselfish, Pomacentrus wardi, we show how to measure IIV when behaviour systematically changes over a series of observations (e.g. as a result of habituation), and how to avoid the adverse effects of censored data on estimates of IIV. After controlling for systematic changes in behaviour over time, we observed strong, significant individual differences in IIV in both species. That is, some individuals were much more predictable in the same situation than were others. We conclude by discussing proximate and ultimate factors that might have contributed to interindividual variation in IIV in these species, and the implications of our findings for methods currently used to study individual differences in behaviour in animals.},

  abstract = {The tactile sense provides animals with vital information about their immediate environment, comprising cues on object location and surface properties. In insects and other arthropods, the antennae are probably the most important part of this tactile sense. The paired insect antenna is regarded as a true, segmented limb arising from the cranium, although there is still some debate about the precise number of segments in the head of the Mandibulata (Crustacea, Myriapoda and Insecta; Schmidt-Ott and Technau, 1992; Schmidt-Ott et al., 1994; Damen et al., 1998; Abzhanov and Kaufman, 1999; Boyan and Williams, 2002). Hennig (1986) uses the name Antennata as a synonym for the Mandibulata, expressing the fact that this taxon comprises all living arthropod species with antennae. The most ancient arthropods, the extinct trilobites, also carried antennae, which is why the 1st pair of antennae is typically considered to be the first pair of limbs, i.e. articulated appendages, in the ground plan of all arthropods. Accordingly, the Chelicerata are thought to have secondarily lost their antennae. Within the Mandibulata, the Crustacea carry two pairs of antennae: the antennules (first pair) are appendages of the deutocerebral segment and are considered to be homologous to the insect antenna, whereas the second pair of antennae are the appendages of the so-called tritocerebral segment (Hennig, 1986; Brusca and Brusca, 1990; Telford and Thomas, 1998; Boyan et al., 2002). Insects have lost the second pair of antennae during evolution. Antennae are equipped with various types of mechanoreceptors, including large numbers of exteroreceptive sensory hairs, but also proprioreceptors such as internal chordotonal organs, external hair plates, and campaniform sensilla. Being moveable, the antennae can actively sample the space surrounding the animal, thus aiding the localisation of obstacles, recognition of conspecifics or predators, active tracking of objects, or probing of surface structures. Because both passive and active movements can occur during tactile sensing, the tactile sensory system requires integration of proprioreceptive and exteroreceptive information in order to locate the stimulus source. Moreover, self-induced sensory stimulation may have to be predicted from motor commands, and compared with the actual sensory input. Therefore, understanding the neurobiology of the tactile sense of insects and crustaceans requires an integrative view of the motor physiology and biomechanics on the one hand, and of the neurophysiology of the participating sensory and interneuronal structures on the other. In the light of this knowledge, the functional significance of the various system components can be interpreted for a range of natural behaviours. The last integrative view on insect antennae that included all known sensory modalities was given by Schneider (1964). Since then, much progress has been made, not only in the field of insect olfaction (e.g. Hansson, 1999) and the sensory physiology of mechanoreceptors (e.g. McIver, 1975, 1985; Zacharuk, 1985), but also in elucidating key components in tactile behaviours such as the localisation of obstacles or physical interactions in intraspecific communication. To illustrate this body of knowledge, and to extend and contrast the mentioned reports on mechanoreception, it is the aim of the present review to combine aspects of antennal biomechanics, mechanoreception, processing of tactile information, and the behavioural repertoire involving the antennal tactile sense. Each of these aspects will be treated in separate sections, concentrating on prominent animal model systems, such as the cockroach (mainly Periplaneta americana L. and Blaberus sp.), stick insect (Carausius morosus Br.), cricket (Gryllus sp., Teleogryllus sp. and Acheta domesticus L.), locust (Locusta migratoria L. and Schistocerca gregaria Forsk\aa l) and the honeybee (Apis mellifera L.). For comparison with a related animal group that employs very similar, though not homologous, organs in tactile sensing, we will expand our view on decapod crustaceans, notably crayfish and lobsters. Finally, we discuss the potential of active tactile sensing from a technical perspective, to point at a helpful mutual exchange between engineering and animal physiology. \textcopyright{} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

As global hotspots of marine biodiversity, lower-income nations in the tropics have for too long been the subject of inequitable and unfair research practices1. However, to date there has been little quantifiable evidence of this phenomenon in marine science. Here, we provide evidence through systematic literature searches and queries that parachute science practices are still widespread in marine research and make some recommendations to help change the current status quo.

Neurons in nearly all regions responded non-specifically when the mouse initiated an action. By contrast, neurons encoding visual stimuli and upcoming choices occupied restricted regions in the~neocortex, basal ganglia and midbrain. Choice signals were rare and emerged with indistinguishable timing across regions. Midbrain neurons were activated before contralateral choices and were suppressed before ipsilateral choices, whereas forebrain neurons could prefer either side. Brain-wide pre-stimulus activity predicted engagement in individual trials and in the overall task, with enhanced subcortical but suppressed neocortical activity during engagement. These results reveal organizing principles for the distribution of neurons encoding behaviourally relevant variables across the mouse brain.},

  abstract = {Rats respond to sustained sleep deprivation with increased mortality preceded by a rise in resting metabolic rate that may or may not be attributed to dysfunction of the thermoregulatory system. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that deprivation of sleep-like rest will lead to increased metabolic rate in an ectothermic insect, the Pacific beetle cockroach. A mild alerting stimulus consisting of a brief \&lt;1\% pulse of CO2 and simultaneous 2 s rotation (1 cm motion) of the animal chamber consistently prevented the adoption of a sleep-like resting posture in cockroaches. Two groups of 15 male adult cockroaches were studied; a group targeted for deprivation of sleep-like rest (SD) was presented with one stimulus per minute continuously, and a group of stimulus controls (SC) was given the same number of stimuli per day but scheduled such that the animals received a 3 h interval without stimuli four times per day. This protocol led to significantly increased mortality in the SD group beginning on day 17(averaging 0.57 deaths per day thereafter), but not in the SC group (averaging 0.17 deaths per day throughout). Oxygen consumption({\.V}O2) increased significantly after 4 weeks in the SD group but not the SC group. {\.V}O2 was 82\% above pre-deprivation baseline after 35 days in the SD group (P=0.009). Body mass was unchanged throughout. We conclude that sleep-like rest is essential for long-term viability in insects and that prolonged vigilance leads to an increase in whole-animal metabolic rate in this ectothermic species.},

In order to obtain the most unbiased estimate of how whole-brain network states evolve through the human sleep cycle, we used a Markovian data-driven analysis of continuous neuroimaging data from 57 healthy participants falling asleep during simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and EEG. This Hidden Markov Model (HMM) facilitated discovery of the dynamic choreography between different whole-brain networks across the wake-non-REM sleep cycle. Notably, our results reveal key trajectories to switch within and between EEG-based sleep stages, while highlighting the heterogeneities of stage N1 sleep and wakefulness before and after sleep.},

  abstract = {Intra-class correlations (ICC) and repeatabilities (R) are fundamental statistics for quantifying the reproducibility of measurements and for understanding the structure of biological variation. Linear mixed effects models offer a versatile framework for estimating ICC and R. However, while point estimation and significance testing by likelihood ratio tests is straightforward, the quantification of uncertainty is not as easily achieved. A further complication arises when the analysis is conducted on data with non-Gaussian distributions because the separation of the mean and the variance is less clear-cut for non-Gaussian than for Gaussian models. Nonetheless, there are solutions to approximate repeatability for the most widely used families of generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs). Here, we introduce the R package rptR for the estimation of ICC and R for Gaussian, binomial and Poisson-distributed data. Uncertainty in estimators is quantified by parametric bootstrapping and significance testing is implemented by likelihood ratio tests and through permutation of residuals. The package allows control for fixed effects and thus the estimation of adjusted repeatabilities (that remove fixed effect variance from the estimate) and enhanced agreement repeatabilities (that add fixed effect variance to the denominator). Furthermore, repeatability can be estimated from random-slope models. The package features convenient summary and plotting functions. Besides repeatabilities, the package also allows the quantification of coefficients of determination R2 as well as of raw variance components. We present an example analysis to demonstrate the core features and discuss some of the limitations of rptR.},

This novel paradigm achieves control over the fly's visual input by continuously evaluating its actual position and orientation. In experiments with natural visual feedback (closed-loop conditions), the optomotor turning induced by horizontal pattern motion in freely walking Drosophila melanogaster increased with the contrast and brightness of the stimulus. Conspicuously striped patterns were followed with variable speed but often without significant overall slippage. Using standard open-loop conditions in stationary walking flies and virtual open-loop or closed-loop conditions in freely walking flies, we compared horizontal turning induced by either horizontal or vertical motion of appropriately oriented rhombic figures. We found (i) that horizontal displacements and the horizontal-motion illusion induced by vertical displacements of the oblique edges of the rhombic figures elicited equivalent open-loop turning responses; (ii) that locomotion-induced visual feedback from the vertical edges of the rhombic figures in a stationary horizontal position diminished the closed-loop turning elicited by vertical displacements to only one-fifth of the response to horizontal displacements; and (iii) that virtual open-loop responses of mobile flies and open-loop responses of immobilized flies were equivalent in spite of delays of up to 0.1 s in the generation of the virtual stimulus. Horizontal compensatory turning upon vertical displacements of oblique edges is quantitatively consistent with the direction-selective summation of signals from an array of elementary motion detectors for the horizontal stimulus components within their narrow receptive fields. A compensation of the aperture-induced ambiguity can be excluded under these conditions. However, locomotion-induced visual feedback greatly diminished the horizontal-motion illusion in a freely walking fly. The illusion was used to assay the quality of open-loop simulation in the new paradigm.},

The receptors for detecting substrate vibrations are often highly sensitive scolopidial sensilla localized within the legs or the body. For troglobitic insects the evolutionary changes in vibroreceptor organs have not been studied. Since rock is an extremely unfavorable medium for vibration transmission, selection on vibration receptors may be weakened in caves, and these sensory organs may undergo regressive evolution. We investigated the anatomy of the most elaborate internal vibration detection system in orthopteroid insects, the scolopidial subgenual organ complex in the cave cricket \emph{Dolichopoda araneiformis} (Orthoptera: Ensifera: Rhaphidophoridae). This is a suitable model species which shows high levels of adaptation to cave life in terms of both phenotypic and life cycle characteristics. We compared our data with data on the anatomy and physiology of the subgenual organ complex from the related troglophilic species \emph{Troglophilus neglectus}. In \emph{D. araneiformis}, the subgenual organ complex contains three scolopidial organs: the subgenual organ, the intermediate organ, and the accessory organ. The presence of individual organs and their innervation pattern are identical to those found in \emph{T. neglectus}, while the subgenual organ and the accessory organ of \emph{D. araneiformis} contain about 50\% fewer scolopidial sensilla than in \emph{T. neglectus}. This suggests neuronal regression of these organs in \emph{D. araneiformis}, which may reflect a relaxed selection pressure for vibration detection in caves. At the same time, a high level of overall neuroanatomical conservation of the intermediate organ in this species suggests persistence of the selection pressure maintaining this particular organ. While regressive evolution of chordotonal organs has been documented for insect auditory organs, this study shows for the first time that internal vibroreceptors can also be affected.},

  abstract = {Ecologists have recently begun to recognize sleep as a behaviour that is important in animal ecology. The first steps have been taken to characterize sleep in free-living birds, but it is unclear to what extent these results can be generalized between species. To describe sleep behaviour in the wild, we videorecorded great tits, Parus major, in their roosting boxes during two consecutive winters and individuals in captivity for comparison. Here, we examined endogenous and exogenous correlates of sleep behaviour in free-living great tits and addressed the potential confounding issues of studying avian sleep in captivity. Like that in blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus, sleep behaviour in great tits was strongly related to season, and was affected by sex, age and the environment. Although literature suggests relationships between sleep and risk-taking behaviours, possibly arising from stable differences in physiological state, sleep behaviour appeared to be plastic in great tits, and was not predicted by between-individual variation in exploratory tendencies. Captive tits initiated sleep later than wild individuals, even under natural photoperiodic conditions, suggesting that captivity alters timing and duration of sleep in great tits. Long-term repeatability in sleep behaviour was low for all variables, except morning latency (high repeatability) and evening box entry time, evening latency and frequency of awakenings (no detectable repeatability). Variation in sleep behaviour may largely represent within-individual differences in daily sleep requirements. Our study describes how different observable components of sleep are intercorrelated by providing evidence for significant within-individual correlations between sleep behaviours, which represent the integration of plasticity between traits. Consistent with low repeatability, low between-individual correlations suggest substantial behavioural plasticity in sleep, rather than a correlational structure leading to clear sleep `syndromes'. Our study provides quantitative evidence for the factors producing phenotypic plasticity in behavioural sleep in an ecological context.},

Commercial platforms have enabled semi high-throughput behavioral analyses by providing accurate tracking of animals, yet they often struggle with the analysis of ethologically relevant behaviors and lack the flexibility to adapt to variable testing environments. In the last couple of years, substantial advances in deep learning and machine vision have given researchers the ability to take behavioral analysis entirely into their own hands. Here, we directly compare the performance of commercially available platforms (Ethovision XT14, Noldus; TSE Multi Conditioning System, TSE Systems) to cross-verified human annotation. To this end, we provide a set of videos - carefully annotated by several human raters - of three widely used behavioral tests (open field, elevated plus maze, forced swim test). Using these data, we show that by combining deep learning-based motion tracking (DeepLabCut) with simple post-analysis, we can track animals in a range of classic behavioral tests at similar or even greater accuracy than commercial behavioral solutions. In addition, we integrate the tracking data from DeepLabCut with post analysis supervised machine learning approaches. This combination allows us to score ethologically relevant behaviors with similar accuracy to humans, the current gold standard, thus outperforming commercial solutions. Moreover, the resulting machine learning approach eliminates variation both within and between human annotators. In summary, our approach helps to improve the quality and accuracy of behavioral data, outperforming commercial systems at a fraction of the cost.}

To formalize this hypothesis, we trained recurrent neural networks to reproduce the muscle activity of reaching monkeys. Models had to infer dynamics that could transform simple inputs into temporally and spatially complex patterns of muscle activity. Analysis of trained models revealed that the natural dynamical solution was a low-dimensional oscillator that generated the necessary multiphasic commands. This solution closely resembled, at both the single-neuron and population levels, what was observed in neural recordings from the same monkeys. Notably, data and simulations agreed only when models were optimized to find simple solutions. An appealing interpretation is that the empirically observed dynamics of motor cortex may reflect a simple solution to the problem of generating temporally patterned descending commands.},

While the importance of rate coding is well established, it remains controversial whether temporal codes alone are sufficient for controlling behavior. Moreover, the molecular mechanisms underlying the generation of specific temporal codes are enigmatic. Here, we show in Drosophila clock neurons that distinct temporal spike patterns, dissociated from changes in firing rate, encode time-dependent arousal and regulate sleep. From a large-scale genetic screen, we identify the molecular pathways mediating the circadian-dependent changes in ionic flux and spike morphology that rhythmically modulate spike timing. Remarkably, the daytime spiking pattern alone is sufficient to drive plasticity in downstream arousal neurons, leading to increased firing of these cells. These findings demonstrate a causal role for temporal coding in behavior and define a form of synaptic plasticity triggered solely by temporal spike patterns. Temporal patterns of Drosophila clock neuron firing are sufficient to drive synaptic plasticity, impacting neuronal function and behavior.},

  abstract = {The dynamic nature of sleep in many animals suggests distinct stages which serve different functions. Genetic sleep induction methods in animal models provide a powerful way to disambiguate these stages and functions, although behavioral methods alone are insufficient to accurately identify what kind of sleep is being engaged. In Drosophila, activation of the dorsal fan-shaped body (dFB) promotes sleep, but it remains unclear what kind of sleep this is, how the rest of the fly brain is behaving, or if any specific sleep functions are being achieved. Here, we developed a method to record calcium activity from thousands of neurons across a volume of the fly brain during spontaneous sleep and compared this to dFB-induced sleep. We found that spontaneous sleep typically transitions from an active `wake like' stage to a less active stage. In contrast, optogenetic activation of the dFB promotes sustained wake-like levels of neural activity, even though flies become unresponsive to mechanical stimuli. When we probed flies with salient visual stimuli, we found that the activity of visually responsive neurons in the central brain was blocked by transient dFB activation, confirming an acute disconnect from the external environment. Prolonged optogenetic dFB activation nevertheless achieved a key sleep function, by correcting visual attention defects brought on by sleep deprivation. These results suggest that dFB activation promotes a distinct form of sleep in Drosophila, where brain activity appears similar to wakefulness, but responsiveness to external sensory stimuli is profoundly suppressed.,  , Tainton-Heap et al. track calcium activity in neurons across the fly brain to compare spontaneous and optogenetically induced sleep. They uncover an active, wake-like sleep stage as well as a less active deep sleep stage. Induced sleep appears to promote wake-like levels of brain activity, while suppressing responsiveness to external stimuli.},

Here, we combined genetic strategies with paired intracellular and local field potential (LFP) recordings from the intact brain of Drosophila to study mechanisms of odor-evoked neural oscillations. We found common food odors at natural concentrations elicited oscillations in LFP recordings made from the mushroom body (MB), a site of sensory integration and analogous to the vertebrate piriform cortex. The oscillations were reversibly abolished by application of the GABAa blocker picrotoxin. Intracellular recordings from local and projection neurons within the antennal lobe (AL) (analogous to the olfactory bulb) revealed odor-elicited spikes and subthreshold membrane potential oscillations that were tightly phase locked to LFP oscillations recorded downstream in the MBs. These results suggested that, as in locusts, odors may elicit the oscillatory synchronization of AL neurons by means of GABAergic inhibition from local neurons (LNs). An analysis of the morphologies of genetically distinguished LNs revealed two populations of GABAergic neurons in the AL. One population of LNs innervated parts of glomeruli lacking terminals of receptor neurons, whereas the other branched more widely, innervating throughout the glomeruli, suggesting that the two populations might participate in different neural circuits. To test the functional roles of these LNs, we used the temperature-sensitive dynamin mutant gene shibire to conditionally and reversibly block chemical transmission from each or both of these populations of LNs. We found only the more widely branching population of LNs is necessary for generating odor-elicited oscillations. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2009 Society for Neuroscience.},

  abstract = {When using virtual-reality paradigms to study animal behaviour, careful attention must be paid to how the animal's actions are detected. This is particularly relevant in closed-loop experiments where the animal interacts with a stimulus. Many different sensor types have been used to measure aspects of behaviour, and although some sensors may be more accurate than others, few studies have examined whether, and how, such differences affect an animal's behaviour in a closed-loop experiment. To investigate this issue, we conducted experiments with tethered honeybees walking on an air-supported trackball and fixating a visual object in closed-loop. Bees walked faster and along straighter paths when the motion of the trackball was measured in the classical fashion \textendash{} using optical motion sensors repurposed from computer mice \textendash{} than when measured more accurately using a computer vision algorithm called `FicTrac'. When computer mouse sensors were used to measure bees' behaviour, the bees modified their behaviour and achieved improved control of the stimulus. This behavioural change appears to be a response to a systematic error in the computer mouse sensor that reduces the sensitivity of this sensor system under certain conditions. Although the large perceived inertia and mass of the trackball relative to the honeybee is a limitation of tethered walking paradigms, observing differences depending on the sensor system used to measure bee behaviour was not expected. This study suggests that bees are capable of fine-tuning their motor control to improve the outcome of the task they are performing. Further, our findings show that caution is required when designing virtual-reality experiments, as animals can potentially respond to the artificial scenario in unexpected and unintended ways.},

  abstract = {Workers in many eusocial insect species show a phenomenon sometimes referred to as `elitism', in which a small proportion of individual workers engaged in a task perform a disproportionately large fraction of the work achieved by the colony as a whole. This phenomenon has not been well studied for foraging behaviour in honeybees (Apis mellifera) because detailed observational studies of foraging activity have been limited by the difficulty of successfully tracking large numbers of individual workers. Here, we used radio frequency identification technology to monitor honeybee flight behaviour automatically and generate lifetime flight activity records for large numbers of individuals from multiple colonies. We observed a consistent skew in activity levels of honeybee foragers, similar to that reported in many other social insects. However, this skew was a consequence of modulation of foraging activity by environmental and social factors rather than the existence of a distinct group or subcaste of elite foragers. Individual responses to experimental manipulation of the foraging workforce confirmed that activity level was flexibly adjusted according to colony needs. These results demonstrate that elitism in insect societies can arise as the extreme of a stable spectrum of individual behavioural activity that allows the colony to respond easily to unexpected needs rather than relying on responses of a rigidly defined subgroup of workers.},

  abstract = {Olive fruit flies, Bactrocera oleae (Diptera: Tephritidae) that are laboratory reared in artificial diet are essential for the genetic control techniques for this pest. However, the colony's laboratory adaptation can affect their quality. We used the Locomotor Activity Monitor (LAM25, Trikinetics, MA, USA) to track the activity and sleep patterns of adult olive fruit flies reared as immatures in olives (F2-F3 generation) and in artificial diet ({$>$}300 generations). Counts of beam breaks caused by the adult fly activity were used as an estimation of its locomotor activity levels during the light and dark period. A longer than five minutes period of adults' inactivity during the dark period was considered as one sleep episode. Activity levels and sleep parameters were found to be dependent on sex, mating status and rearing history. In virgin flies reared in olives, males were more active than females and increased their locomotor activity towards the end of the light period. Mating decreased the locomotor activity levels of males, but not of females olive-reared flies. Laboratory flies reared in artificial diet had lower locomotor activity levels during the light period and more sleep episodes of shorter duration compared to flies reared in olives. We describe the diurnal locomotor activity patterns of B. oleae adults reared in olive fruits and in artificial diet. We discuss how locomotor activity and sleep pattern differences may affect the laboratory flies' ability to compete with wild males in the field.},

I investigated the consequences of disturbances of the rest period on activity states of the cockroach Leucophea maderae. The 24-h rest-activity rhythm of individual animals maintained under a 12 h light-12 h dark schedule was continuously recorded by timelapse video recording. Three activity states were scored: locomotion, immobility, and limb or antenna movements without locomotion. The effect of (i) 3 h forced activity; and of (ii) handling and a new environment was studied. Forced activity during the last 3 h of the light period caused a significant reduction of locomotion, and of limb or antenna movements; and an enhancement of immobility in the first hours of the dark period. However, over the entire 12 h dark period, these parameters did not differ from control. Brief handling in conjunction with a change in environment during the last 3 h of the dark period, was followed by similar, though smaller changes in locomotion as seen after forced locomotion. The results indicate that the time spent in immobility corresponds to a resting state which is regulated as a function of prior activity. Thus immobility in an invertebrate may exhibit similar regulating mechanisms as rest or sleep in vertebrates. \textcopyright{} 1983.},

  abstract = {Our objective was to investigate whether sleep-like states occur in the cockroach, Blaberus giganteus by applying the methods formerly used for another cockroach species, Leucophaea maderae and the scorpions, Heterometrus and Pandinus. The behaviour of isolated animals (n= 10) kept under LD 12:12 h was recorded by time-lapse video for three consecutive 24-h periods. Nine behavioural states were scored for 1-min real-time epochs. Rest was subdivided into 4 sub-states on the basis of body posture and the position of the antennae. The cockroaches showed a nocturnal behaviour exhibiting a bout of locomotion at dark onset which lasted several hours, and a preference for rest in the light period. Immobility with both the body and the antennae touching the substrate (state 1) was the predominating state in the light period. In order to establish whether the sub-states of rest represented different levels of vigilance the arousal threshold was measured by determining the latency of a behavioural response to a vibration stimulus. The levels of arousal differed significantly in four behavioural states in the light period but not in the dark period. In state 1 the animals exhibited the lowest arousal whereas in the activity states arousal was the highest. The state with the highest arousal threshold occurred in the beginning of the light period. Thereafter, arousal progressively increased and remained relatively high during the dark period. The effect of 6-h deprivation of rest by the gentle shaking of the cages whenever the animals were immobile, resulted in a reduced latency to state 1, a small increase of state 1 and a more prominent initial increase of activity during recovery. In conclusion, this study provides evidence for the existence of a 24-h variation of vigilance in the cockroach. It further indicates that a `rest deficit' gives rise to a compensatory response. The data support the notion that sleep-like states are present in these insects.},

When coupled with large behavioral data sets, unsupervised clustering methods offer the potential of unbiased mapping of behavioral spaces. However, unsupervised techniques to map behavioral spaces are in their infancy, and there have been few systematic considerations of all the methodological options. We compared the performance of seven distinct mapping methods in clustering a wavelet-transformed data set consisting of the x- and y-positions of the six legs of individual flies. Legs were automatically tracked by small pieces of fluorescent dye, while the fly was tethered and walking on an air-suspended ball. We find that there is considerable variation in the performance of these mapping methods, and that better performance is attained when clustering is done in higher dimensional spaces (which are otherwise less preferable because they are hard to visualize). High dimensionality means that some algorithms, including the non-parametric watershed cluster assignment algorithm, cannot be used. We developed an alternative watershed algorithm which can be used in high-dimensional spaces when a probability density estimate can be computed directly. With these tools in hand, we examined the behavioral space of fly leg postural dynamics and locomotion. We find a striking division of behavior into modes involving the fore legs and modes involving the hind legs, with few direct transitions between them. By computing behavioral clusters using the data from all flies simultaneously, we show that this division appears to be common to all flies. We also identify individual-to-individual differences in behavior and behavioral transitions. Lastly, we suggest a computational pipeline that can achieve satisfactory levels of performance without the taxing computational demands of a systematic combinatorial approach.},

This paper discusses a hypothesis about the significance of slow-wave activity and its homeostatic regulation. The hypothesis is as follows: Wakefulness is associated with synaptic potentiation in several cortical circuits; Synaptic potentiation is tied to the homeostatic regulation of slow-wave activity; Slow-wave activity is associated with synaptic downscaling; Synaptic downscaling is tied to the beneficial effects of sleep on performance.The hypothesized link between sleep and synaptic homeostasis is supported by several lines of evidence and leads to testable predictions. \textcopyright{} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Background: Consciousness poses two main problems. The first is understanding the conditions that determine to what extent a system has conscious experience. For instance, why is our consciousness generated by certain parts of our brain, such as the thalamocortical system, and not by other parts, such as the cerebellum? And why are we conscious during wakefulness and much less so during dreamless sleep? The second problem is understanding the conditions that determine what kind of consciousness a system has. For example, why do specific parts of the brain contribute specific qualities to our conscious experience, such as vision and audition? Presentation of the hypothesis: This paper presents a theory about what consciousness is and how it can be measured. According to the theory, consciousness corresponds to the capacity of a system to integrate information. This claim is motivated by two key phenomenological properties of consciousness: differentiation - the availability of a very large number of conscious experiences; and integration - the unity of each such experience. The theory states that the quantity of consciousness available to a system can be measured as the {$\Phi$} value of a complex of elements. {$\Phi$} is the amount of causally effective information that can be integrated across the informational weakest link of a subset of elements. A complex is a subset of elements with {$\Phi>$}0 that is not part of a subset of higher {$\Phi$}. The theory also claims that the quality of consciousness is determined by the informational relationships among the elements of a complex, which are specified by the values of effective information among them. Finally, each particular conscious experience is specified by the value, at any given time, of the variables mediating informational interactions among the elements of a complex. Testing the hypothesis: The information integration theory accounts, in a principled manner, for several neurobiological observations concerning consciousness. As shown here, these include the association of consciousness with certain neural systems rather than with others; the fact that neural processes underlying consciousness can influence or be influenced by neural processes that remain unconscious; the reduction of consciousness during dreamless sleep and generalized seizures; and the time requirements on neural interactions that support consciousness. Implications of the hypothesis: The theory entails that consciousness is a fundamental quantity, that it is graded, that it is present in infants and animals, and that it should be possible to build conscious artifacts. \textcopyright{} 2004 Tononi; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

  abstract = {Sleep is universal, tightly regulated, and its loss impairs cognition. But why does the brain need todisconnect from the environment for hours every day? The synaptic homeostasis hypothesis (SHY)proposes that sleep is the price the brain pays for plasticity. During a waking episode, learning statistical regularities about the current environment requires strengthening connections throughout thebrain. This increases cellular needs for energy and supplies, decreases signal-to-noise ratios, and saturates learning. During sleep, spontaneous activity renormalizes net synaptic strength and restores cellular homeostasis. Activity-dependent down-selection of synapses can also explain the benefits of sleep on memory acquisition, consolidation, and integration. This happens through the offline, comprehensive sampling of statistical regularities incorporated in neuronal circuits over a lifetime. This Perspective considers the rationale and evidence for SHY and points to open issues related to sleep and plasticity. What is the purpose of sleep? The synaptic homeostasis hypothesis (SHY) proposes that sleep renormalizes net synaptic strength and restores cellular homeostasis. Tononi and Cirelli review the rationale and evidence behind SHY and discuss open issues related to sleep and plasticity. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {The science of consciousness has made great strides by focusing on the behavioural and neuronal correlates of experience. However, while such correlates are important for progress to occur, they are not enough if we are to understand even basic facts, for example, why the cerebral cortex gives rise to consciousness but the cerebellum does not, though it has even more neurons and appears to be just as complicated. Moreover, correlates are of little help in many instances where we would like to know if consciousness is present: patients with a few remaining islands of functioning cortex, preterm infants, non-mammalian species and machines that are rapidly outperforming people at driving, recognizing faces and objects, and answering difficult questions. To address these issues, we need not only more data but also a theory of consciousness\textemdash one that says what experience is and what type of physical systems can have it. Integrated information theory (IIT) does so by starting from experience itself via five phenomenological axioms: intrinsic existence, composition, information, integration and exclusion. From these it derives five postulates about the properties required of physical mechanisms to support consciousness. The theory provides a principled account of both the quantity and the quality of an individual experience (a quale), and a calculus to evaluate whether or not a particular physical system is conscious and of what. Moreover,IIT can explain a range of clinical and laboratory findings, makes a number of testable predictions and extrapolates to a number of problematic conditions. The theory holds that consciousness is a fundamental property possessed by physical systems having specific causal properties. It predicts that consciousness is graded, is common among biological organisms and can occur in some very simple systems. Conversely, it predicts that feed-forward networks, even complex ones, are not conscious, nor are aggregates such as groups of individuals or heaps of sand. Also, in sharp contrast to widespread functionalist beliefs, IIT implies that digital computers, even if their behaviour were to be functionally equivalent to ours, and even if they were to run faithful simulations of the human brain, would experience next to nothing.},

Portable Medilog tape-recorders were used for ambulatory EEG monitoring of 25 male papermill workders (25\textendash 55 years) during days with night and afternoon work. The rusults showed that sleep after night work was two hours shorter than after afternoon worl. The sleep reduction affected mainly Stage 2 and REM sleep while slow wave sleep was unchanged. In connection with night work 28\% of the workders took a nap in the afternoon. These naps contained a large proportion of slow wave sleep and were, apparently, caused by the sleep deficit after the short main sleep period. The EEG recordings also revealed that 20\% of the participants had sleep episodes during night work. These naps were as long as the afternoon naps, were experienced as ``dozing off'' ragher than naps. Occurred at the time of the though of the circadian wakefulness rhythm, and were concomitant with extreme subjective sleepiness and low rated work load. It was concluded that not only the sleep of shift workders was disturbed, but also the wakefulness- to the extent that sleepiness during night work sometimes reached a level where reasonable wakefulness could not be maintained. The latter observation is probably of special importance in work situations demanding a great responsiility of human lives or for great economic values.},

The ecology of sleep has been particularly neglected in invertebrates. In insects, recent neurobehavioral research convincingly demonstrates that resting behavior shares several common characteristics with sleep in vertebrates. Laboratory studies have produced compelling evidence that sleep disruption can cause changes in insect daily activity patterns (via ``sleep rebound'') and have consequences for behavioral performance during active periods. However, factors that could cause insect sleep disruption in nature have not been considered nor have the ecological consequences. Drawing on evidence from laboratory studies, we argue that sleep disruption may be an overlooked component of insect ecology and could be caused by a variety of anthropogenic and nonanthropogenic factors in nature. We identify several candidate sleep-disrupting factors and provide new insights on the potential consequences of sleep disruption on individual fitness, species interactions, and ecosystem services. We propose an experimental framework to bridge the current gap in knowledge between laboratory and field studies. We conclude that sleep disruption is a potential mechanism underpinning variation in behavioral, population, and community-level processes associated with several aspects of global change.},

This article, which is admittedly controversial, attempts to raise many issues that surround this area. To commence use of the term intelligence with regard to plant behaviour will lead to a better understanding of the complexity of plant signal transduction and the discrimination and sensitivity with which plants construct images of their environment, and raises critical questions concerning how plants compute responses at the whole-plant level. Approaches to investigating learning and memory in plants will also be considered. (C) 2003 Annals of Botany Company},

We have investigated the onset and progression of pathological changes in Ppt1 deficient mice (Ppt1-/-) and the development of their seizure phenotype. Surprisingly, cortical atrophy and neuron loss occurred only late in disease progression but were preceded by localized astrocytosis within individual thalamic nuclei and the progressive loss of thalamic neurons that relay different sensory modalities to the cortex. This thalamic neuron loss occurred first within the visual system and only subsequently in auditory and somatosensory relay nuclei or the inhibitory reticular thalamic nucleus. The loss of granule neurons and GABAergic interneurons followed in each corresponding cortical region, before the onset of seizure activity. These findings provide novel evidence for successive neuron loss within the thalamus and cortex in Ppt1-/- mice, revealing the thalamus as an important early focus of INCL pathogenesis.},

Such a compass representation was recently discovered in a neural population in the Drosophila melanogaster central complex, a brain region implicated in spatial navigation. Here, we use two-photon calcium imaging and electrophysiology in head-fixed walking flies to identify a different neural population that conjunctively encodes heading and angular velocity, and is excited selectively by turns in either the clockwise or counterclockwise direction. We show how these mirror-symmetric turn responses combine with the neurons' connectivity to the compass neurons to create an elegant mechanism for updating the fly's heading representation when the animal turns in darkness. This mechanism, which employs recurrent loops with an angular shift, bears a resemblance to those proposed in theoretical models for rodent head direction cells. Our results provide a striking example of structure matching function for a broadly relevant computation.},

  abstract = {Problematic Humans are able to accurately track a moving object with a combi-nation of saccades and smooth eye movements. These movements allow us to align and stabilize the object on the fovea, thus en-abling high-resolution visual detection. When predictive informa-tion is available about target motion, anticipatory smooth pursuit eye movements (aSPEM) are efficiently generated before target appearance, which reduce the typical sensorimotor delay between target motion onset and foveation. It is generally assumed that the role of anticipatory eye movements is to limit the behavioral impairment due to eye-to-target position and velocity mismatch. By manipulating the probability for target motion direction we were able to bias the direction and mean velocity of aSPEM, as mea-sured during a fixed duration gap before target ramp-motion onset. This suggests that probabilistic information may be used to inform the internal representation of motion prediction for the initiation of anticipatory movements [1]. However, such estimate may become particularly challenging in a dynamic context, where the probabilistic contingencies vary in time in an unpredictable way. In addition, whether and how the infor-mation processing underlying the buildup of aSPEM is linked to an explicit estimate of probabilities is unknown. Material and Method In order to answer these questions, we have set up an experi-ment comprising 3 blocks of 200 trials. For each trial, a tar-get makes either to the left or to the right, this direction being drawn from a Bernoulli process. The probability of this process varied in a piecewise-constant (that is, a step function varying be-tween 0 and 1), similarly to Meyniel et al. [2]. The occurence of these switches is itself drawn from a Bernoulli process of probability p switch = 1/40. We asked subjects to perform two tasks on different days :},

  abstract = {During sleep, the brain undergoes dynamic and structural changes. In Drosophila, such changes have been observed in the central complex, a brain area important for sleep control and navigation. For navigation, the structure and function of the central complex suggest a relationship to ring attractors, networks that model head direction. This raises the question about a similar structure-function relationship for sleep control.Motivated by experimental findings, we develop a ring attractor model that maintains activity at a setpoint in the face of plasticity. In this model, an integrator of sleep drive emerges with a functional role in stabilizing the network. Nevertheless, the network becomes unstable over extended wake time. Therefore, a sleep phase is introduced where autonomous attractor dynamics, related to its activity during wakefulness, reset the network. The proposed integration of sleep and head direction circuits captures features of their neural dynamics observed in flies and mice during wakefulness and sleep.Author Summary In Drosophila, the study of sleep and the study of navigation are largely disconnected fields, even though the same brain structures and connected neural circuits are important for the two different functionalities. Motivated by experimental results from both fields, we use theoretical modeling to describe the coupled dynamics of sleep and navigation circuits and propose a rationale for why they interact. The resulting model can incorporate and explain several experimental findings about sleep and navigation in flies and mice. The model is based on a ring attractor network which is combined with plasticity rules that change between sleep and wake phases and shows autonomous dynamics during sleep, reminiscent of observations in the head direction system of mice.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract = {How might one determine whether simple animals such as flies sleep in stages? Sleep in mammals is a dynamic process involving different stages of sleep intensity, and these are typically associated with measurable changes in brain activity (Blake and Gerard, 1937; Re-chtschaffen and Kales, 1968; Webb and Agnew, 1971). Evidence for different sleep stages in invertebrates remains elusive, even though it has been well established that many invertebrate species require sleep (Campbell and Tobler, 1984; Hendricks et al., 2000; Shaw et al., 2000; Sauer et al., 2003). Here we used electrophysiology and arousal-testing paradigms to show that the fruit fly, Drosophila melano-gaster, transitions between deeper and lighter sleep within extended bouts of inactivity, with deeper sleep intensities after \textasciitilde{} 15 and \textasciitilde 30 min of inactivity. As in mammals, the timing and intensity of these dynamic sleep processes in flies is homeostatically regulated and modulated by behavioral experience. Two molecules linked to synaptic plasticity regulate the intensity of the first deep sleep stage. Optogenetic upregulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate during the day increases sleep intensity at night, whereas loss of function of a molecule involved in synaptic pruning, the fragile-X mental retardation protein, increases sleep intensity during the day. Our results show that sleep is not homogenous in insects, and suggest that waking behavior and the associated synaptic plasticity mechanisms determine the timing and intensity of deep sleep stages in Drosophila. \textcopyright{} 2013 the authors.},

Most of the current methods for analyzing root growth require either artificial growing conditions (e.g. hydroponics), are severely restricted in the fraction of roots detectable (e.g. rhizotrons), or are destructive (e.g. soil coring). On the other hand, modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are noninvasive and allow high-quality three-dimensional imaging of roots in soil. Here, we present a plant root imaging and analysis pipeline using MRI together with an advanced image visualization and analysis software toolbox named NMRooting. Pots up to 117 mm in diameter and 800 mm in height can be measured with the 4.7 T MRI instrument used here. For 1.5 L pots (81 mm diameter, 300 mm high), a fully automated system was developed enabling measurement of up to 18 pots per day. The most important root traits that can be nondestructively monitored over time are root mass, length, diameter, tip number, and growth angles (in two-dimensional polar coordinates) and spatial distribution. Various validation measurements for these traits were performed, showing that roots down to a diameter range between 200 mm and 300 mm can be quantitatively measured. Root fresh weight correlates linearly with root mass determined by MRI. We demonstrate the capabilities of MRI and the dedicated imaging pipeline in experimental series performed on soil-grown maize (Zea mays) and barley (Hordeum vulgare) plants.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Unlike physiological loads, the biomechanical loads of training in running-based sports are still largely unexplored. This study, therefore, aimed to assess the validity of estimating ground reaction forces (GRF), as a measure of external whole-body biomechanical loading, from segmental accelerations. Methods: Fifteen team-sport athletes performed accelerations, decelerations, 90\textdegree{} cuts and straight running at different speeds including sprinting. Full-body kinematics and GRF were recorded with a three-dimensional motion capture system and a single force platform respectively. GRF profiles were estimated as the sum of the product of all fifteen segmental masses and accelerations, or a reduced number of segments. Results: Errors for GRF profiles estimated from fifteen segmental accelerations were low (1\textendash 2 N kg-1) for low-speed running, moderate (2\textendash 3 N kg-1) for accelerations, 90\textdegree{} cuts and moderate-speed running, but very high ({$>$}4 N kg-1) for decelerations and high-speed running. Similarly, impulse (2.3\textendash 11.1\%), impact peak (9.2\textendash 28.5\%) and loading rate (20.1\textendash 42.8\%) errors varied across tasks. Moreover, mean errors increased from 3.26 {$\pm$} 1.72 N kg-1 to 6.76 {$\pm$} 3.62 N kg-1 across tasks when the number of segments was reduced. Conclusions: Accuracy of estimated GRF profiles and loading characteristics was dependent on task, and errors substantially increased when the number of segments was reduced. Using a direct mechanical approach to estimate GRF from segmental accelerations is thus unlikely to be a valid method to assess whole-body biomechanical loading across different dynamic and high-intensity activities. Researchers and practitioners should, therefore, be very cautious when interpreting accelerations from one or several segments, as these are unlikely to accurately represent external whole-body biomechanical loads.},

These courses typically use classical electrophysiological preparations to explore the basic features of neuronal function. However, current neuroscience research also focuses on elucidating the molecular and genetic mechanisms of neuronal function, using model systems that include mutant and transgenic animals. To bridge laboratory training in neurophysiology with modern molecular genetics, we describe a teaching model based on electroretinography of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, a long-established model system for basic neuroscience research. Drosophila are easily maintained, economical, and have hundreds of neurophysiologically relevant mutant strains and genetic tools readily available. The Drosophila electroretinogram (ERG) is a simple and accessible extracellular recording of a neural signal in the fly eye in response to flashes of light. The signal is multifaceted and the response is sensitive to stimulation parameters such as intensity, duration and wavelength, thus forming a rich source of analysis for students. Most importantly, different mutations affecting key components of intracellular signaling, synaptic transmission or neuronal function can affect the ERG waveform in characteristic ways. Recording wild type and mutant ERGs allows students to examine firsthand the connection between genetics, biochemical pathways, and electrophysiology. This neurophysiology laboratory course can facilitate and enhance an understanding of the cellular and molecular contributions to neurophysiological recordings.},

However, in recent years it has become increasingly clear that vibrational signals play a crucial role in communication in many insect groups and we provide a short overview. Vibrational signals are related to sexual behavior, alarm and defensive behavior and are often used to mediate coordinated group actions and complex social interactions. For small insects they are probably the least costly and most far-reaching signals for intraspecific communication and also not easily perceived by a potential predator or parasitoid. Substrate-borne signals are produced by diversed methods and detected by sensitive receptors in all six legs. The courtship behavior of the southern green stink bug Nezara viridula (L.) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) is taken as a representative model in illustrating some principal mechanisms of vibrational communication in insects. Species and sex specific vibrational signals produced during the courtship are well suited for propagation through plants and to transmit the relevant information about the species and sex of the sender as well as provide the directional cue for locating the mate. The role of substrate-borne signals as a part of the specific mate recognition systems which are unique for each species makes studies of vibrational signals a very useful tool for resolving taxonomic problems.},

  abstract = {Background: Virtual reality combined with a spherical treadmill is used across species for studying neural circuits underlying navigation and learning. New method: We developed an optical flow-based method for tracking treadmill ball motion in real time using a single high-resolution camera. Results: Tracking accuracy and timing were determined using calibration data. Ball tracking was performed at 500 Hz and integrated with an open source game engine for virtual reality projection. The projection was updated at 120 Hz with a latency with respect to ball motion of 30 {$\pm$} 8 ms. The system was tested for behavior with fruit flies. The application and source code are available at https://github.com/ivan-vishniakou/neural-circuits-vr. Comparison with existing method(s): Optical flow-based tracking of treadmill motion is typically achieved using optical mice. The camera-based optical flow tracking system developed here is based on off-the-shelf components and offers control over the image acquisition and processing parameters. This results in flexibility with respect to tracking conditions \textendash{} such as ball surface texture, lighting conditions, or ball size \textendash{} as well as camera alignment and calibration. Conclusions: A fast system for rotational ball motion tracking suitable for virtual reality behavior with fruit flies was developed and characterized.},

It is often assumed in foraging theory that the flight lengths of a forager have a characteristic scale: from this assumption gaussian, Rayleigh and other classical distributions with well-defined variances have arisen. However, such theories cannot explain the long-tailed power-law distributions of flight lengths or flight times that are observed experimentally. Here we study how the search efficiency depends on the probability distribution of flight lengths taken by a forager that can detect target sites only in its limited vicinity. We show that, when the target sites are sparse and can be visited any number of times, an inverse square power-law distribution of flight lengths, corresponding to Levy flight motion, is an optimal strategy. We test the theory by analyzing experimental foraging data on selected insect, mammal and bird species, and find that they are consistent with the predicted inverse square power-law distributions.},

As such, it has been intensely studied, in particular with respect to population dynamics, sensory processing, feeding behavior flight and locomotor control, migratory behavior, and its neuroendocrine system. Being a long-range migratory species, neural mechanisms underlying sky compass orientation have been studied in detail. To further understand neuronal interactions in the brain of the locust, a deeper understanding of brain organization in this insect has become essential. As a follow-up of a previous study illustrating the layout of the locust brain (Kurylas et al. in J Comp Neurol 484:206\textendash 223, 2008), we analyze the cerebrum, the central brain minus gnathal ganglia, of the desert locust in more detail and provide a digital three-dimensional atlas of 48 distinguishable brain compartments and 7 major fiber tracts and commissures as a basis for future functional studies. Neuropils were three-dimensionally reconstructed from synapsin-immunostained whole mount brains. Neuropil composition and their internal organization were analyzed and compared to the neuropils of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Most brain areas have counterparts in Drosophila. Some neuropils recognized in the locust, however, have not been identified in the fly while certain areas in the fly could not be distinguished in the locust. This study paves the way for more detailed anatomical descriptions of neuronal connections and neuronal cell types in the locust brain, facilitates interspecies comparisons among insect brains and points out possible evolutionary differences in brain organization between hemi- and holometabolous insects.},

Design: Animal behavior and activity were assessed using video recordings to measure activity, resting posture, resting place preference, and behavior after rest deprivation. Latencies for behavioral responses were measured for appetitive and aversive stimuli for animals in the wake and rest states. Setting: Circadian research laboratory for Aplysia. Patients or Participants: A. californica from the Pacific Ocean. Interventions: N/A. Measurements and Results: Aplysia rest almost exclusively during the night in a semi-contracted body position with preferential resting locations in the upper corners of their tank. Resting animals demonstrate longer latencies in head orientation and biting in response to a seaweed stimulus and less frequent escape response steps following an aversive salt stimulus applied to the tail compared to awake animals at the same time point. Aplysia exhibit rebound rest the day following rest deprivation during the night, but not after similar handling stimulation during the day. Conclusions: Resting behavior in Aplysia fulfills all invertebrate characteristics of sleep including: (1) a specific sleep body posture, (2) preferred resting location, (3) reversible behavioral quiescence, (4) elevated arousal thresholds for sensory stimuli during sleep, and (5) compensatory sleep rebound after sleep deprivation.},

Here, we start with a mathematical primer on dynamical systems theory and analytical tools necessary to apply this perspective to experimental data. Next, we highlight some recent discoveries resulting from successful application of dynamical systems. We focus on studies spanning motor control, timing, decision-making, and working memory.

The desert ant Cataglyphis fortis is a prominent example, covering large distances on foraging excursions. The stride integrator is probably the major source of path integration errors. A detailed analysis of walking behaviour in Cataglyphis is thus of importance for assessing possible sources of errors and potential compensation strategies. Zollikofer (J Exp Biol 192:95-106, 1994a) demonstrated consistent use of the tripod gait in Cataglyphis, and suggested an unexpectedly constant stride length as a possible means of reducing navigation errors. Here, we extend these studies by more detailed analyses of walking behaviour across a large range of walking speeds. Stride length increases linearly and stride amplitude of the middle legs increases slightly linearly with walking speed. An initial decrease of swing phase duration is observed at lower velocities with increasing walking speed. Then it stays constant across the behaviourally relevant range of walking speeds. Walking speed is increased by shortening of the stance phase and of the stance phase overlap. At speeds larger than 370 mms(-1), the stride frequency levels off, the duty factor falls below 0.5, and Cataglyphis transitions to running with aerial phases.},

This article presents the findings of a mixed-method study to investigate doctoral experiences of non-academic support, conducted at one British university with a large postgraduate research population. Drawing on focus groups and a student survey, the article concludes that many doctoral students are not accessing institutional support when they could benefit from it, with many turning to external support mechanisms including family, personal doctor and online resources. Five institutional recommendations are proposed to develop improved dedicated doctoral student mental health support: clear signposting, online self-help, workshops, parity of support and supervisor training.},

  abstract = {While on foraging excursions, fiddler crabs track their burrow location despite having no visual contact with it [1-5]. They do this by path integration [3, 6], a common navigational process in which motion vectors (the direction and distance of animals' movements) are summed to form a single "home vector" linking the current location with the point of origin [7]. Here, we identify the mechanism by which the integrator measures distance, by decoupling motor output from both inertial and visual feedback. Fiddler crabs were passively translated to a position such that the home vector lay across an acetate sheet on the ground. After being frightened, crabs tried to escape but slipped as they did so. Detailed high-speed video analysis reveals that crabs measure distance by integrating strides, rather than linear acceleration or optic flow: the number of steps they took depended on both the length of the home vector and how large their steps were, whether they slipped and fell short or not. This is the most direct evidence to date of a stride integrator [8, 9] that is flexible enough to account for significant variation in stride length and frequency. \textcopyright{} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Social insects use cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) to convey different social signals, including colony or nest identity. Despite extensive investigations, the exact source and identity ofCHCs that act as nest-specific identification signals remain largely unknown. Perhaps this is because studies that identify CHC signals typically use organic solvents to extract a single sample from the entire animal, thereby analysing a cocktail of chemicals that may serve several signal functions. We took a novel approach by first identifying CHC profiles from different body parts of ants (Iridomyrmex purpureus), then used behavioural bioassays to reveal the location of specific social signals. The CHC profiles of both workers and alates varied between different body parts, and workers paid more attention to the antennae of non-nest-mate and the legs of nest-mate workers. Workers responded less aggressively to non-nest-mate workers if the CHCs on the antennae of their opponents were removed with a solvent. These data indicate that CHCs located on the antennae reveal nest-mate identity and, remarkably, that antennae both convey and receive social signals. Our approach and findings could be valuably applied to chemical signalling in other behavioural contexts, and provide insights that were otherwise obscured by including chemicals that either have no signal function or may be used in other contexts.},

The success of this behavior depends on the integration of information from both eyes to unequivocally identify all possible translational or rotational directions of motion. However, it is still unknown whether the precise direction of ego-motion is already identified in the zebrafish pretectum or later in downstream premotor areas. RESULTS Here, we show that the zebrafish pretectum and tectum each contain four populations of motion-sensitive direction-selective (DS) neurons, with each population encoding a different preferred direction upon monocular stimulation. In contrast, binocular stimulation revealed the existence of pretectal and tectal neurons that are specifically tuned to only one of the many possible combinations of monocular motion, suggesting that further downstream sensory processing might not be needed to instruct appropriate optokinetic and optomotor behavior. CONCLUSION Our results suggest that local, task-specific pretectal circuits process DS retinal inputs and carry out the binocular sensory computations necessary for optokinetic and optomotor behavior.},

  abstract = {Top predators, particularly seabirds, have repeatedly been suggested as indicators of marine ecosystem status. One region currently under pressure from human fisheries and climate change is the North Sea. Standardized seabird monitoring data have been collected on the Isle of May, an important seabird colony in the northwestern North Sea, over the last 10-20 years. Over this period oceanographic conditions have varied markedly, and between 1990 and 1999 a major industrial fishery for sandlance (Ammodytes marinus), the main prey of most seabird species, was prosecuted nearby. Sandlance fishing grounds close to seabird colonies down the east coast of the UK were closed in 2000 in an attempt to improve foraging opportunities for breeding seabirds, particularly black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla). Initially this closure seemed to be beneficial for kittiwakes with breeding success recovering to pre-fishery levels. However, despite the ban continuing, kittiwakes and many other seabird species in the North Sea suffered severe breeding failures in 2004. In this paper, we test the predictive power of four previously established correlations between kittiwake breeding success and climatic/trophic variables to explain the observed breeding success at the Isle of May in 2004. During the breeding season, kittiwakes at this colony switch from feeding on 1+ group to 0 group sandlance, and results up until 2003 indicated that availability of both age classes had a positive effect on kittiwake breeding success. The low breeding success of kittiwakes in 2004 was consistent with the late appearance and small body size of 0 group sandlance, but at odds with the two variables likely to operate via 1 group availability (lagged winter sea surface temperature and larval sandlance cohort strength in 2003). The reason for the discrepancy is currently unknown, but analysis of 1 group sandlance body composition indicated that lipid content in 2004 was extremely low, and thus fish eaten by kittiwakes during pre-breeding and early incubation were likely to be of poor quality. Monitoring of reproductive success of kittiwakes, although useful, was clearly not sufficient to tease apart the complex causation underlying the 2004 event. Monitoring programs such as this, therefore, need to be complemented by detailed research to identify the mechanisms involved, and to attribute and predict the effects of natural and human-induced environmental change. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

These impressive visual abilities occur at light levels when only a trickle of photons are being absorbed by each photoreceptor, begging the question of how the visual system nonetheless generates the reliable signals needed to steer behaviour. In this review, I attempt to provide an answer to this question. Part of the answer lies in their compound eyes, which maximize light capture. Part lies in the slow responses and high gains of their photoreceptors, which improve the reliability of visual signals. And a very large part lies in the spatial and temporal summation of these signals in the optic lobe, a strategy that substantially enhances contrast sensitivity in dim light and allows nocturnal insects to see a brighter world, albeit a slower and coarser one. What is abundantly clear, however, is that during their evolution insects have overcome several serious potential visual limitations, endowing them with truly extraordinary night vision. This article is part of the themed issue `Vision in dim light'.},

Radial patterns of optical flow could be used to perceive the translational direction of self-motion and to guide locomotion. However, these patterns are confounded by eye movements, which has led previous investigators to reject the outflow pattern and to propose alternative strategies. Using computer-generated displays of optical flow, we show here that humans can perceive their direction of self-motion during stationary fixations, pursuit eye movements, and with displays that simulate the effects of eye movements. We conclude that optical flow is sufficient for perceiving the direction of self-motion and provide evidence for a theory based on differential element motion.}

Fifty years ago, it was proposed that we steer to a goal using optic flow, the pattern of motion at the eye that specifies the direction of locomotion. However, we might also simply walk in the perceived direction of a goal. These two hypotheses normally predict the same behavior, but we tested them in an immersive virtual environment by displacing the optic flow from the direction of walking, violating the laws of optics. We found that people walked in the visual direction of a lone target, but increasingly relied on optic flow as it was added to the display. The visual control law for steering toward a goal is a linear combination of these two variables weighted by the magnitude of flow, thereby allowing humans to have robust locomotor control under varying environmental conditions.},

By optical imaging of a voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) and intracellular recording from secondary olfactory interneurons, we examined possible neural correlates of the spatial and temporal odor representations in the primary olfactory center, the antennal lobe (AL), of the cockroach Periplaneta americana. Voltage-sensitive dye imaging revealed that all used odorants induced odor-specific temporal patterns of depolarizing potentials in specific combinations of anterior glomeruli of the AL. The depolarizing potentials evoked by different odorants were temporally synchronized across glomeruli and were termed "synchronized potentials." These observations suggest that odor qualities are represented by spatio-temporal activity patterns of the synchronized potentials across glomeruli. We also performed intracellular recordings and stainings from secondary olfactory interneurons, namely projection neurons and local interneurons. We analyzed the temporal structures of enanthic acid-induced action potentials of secondary olfactory interneurons using simultaneous paired intracellular recording from two given neurons. Our results indicated that the multiple local interneurons synchronously fired in response to the olfactory stimulus. In addition, all stained enanthic acid-responsive projection neurons exhibited dendritic arborizations within the glomeruli where the synchronized potentials were evoked. Since multiple local interneurons are known to synapse to a projection neuron in each glomerulus in the cockroach AL, converging inputs from local interneurons to the projection neurons appear to contribute the odorant specific spatio-temporal activity patterns of the synchronized potentials. \textcopyright{} 2012 Watanabe, Ai and Yokohari.},

Many species use path integration to maintain an accurate estimate of their distance and direction (a vector) to their nest and can store the vector information for multiple salient locations in the world, such as food sources, in a common coordinate system. Insects can also use remembered views of the terrain around salient locations or along travelled routes to guide return, which is a fundamentally geometric process. Recent modelling of these abilities shows convergence on a small set of algorithms and assumptions that appear sufficient to account for a wide range of behavioural data. Notably, this `base model' does not include any significant topological knowledge: the insect does not need to recover the information (implicit in their vector memory) about the relationships between salient places; nor to maintain any connectedness or ordering information between view memories; nor to form any associations between views and vectors. However, there remains some experimental evidence not fully explained by this base model that may point towards the existence of a more complex or integrated mental map in insects.},

The fact that several of the active features of REM sleep heat the CNS, and the fact that REM sleep propensity increases when core temperature physiologically decreases, seem consistent with the hypothesis that REM sleep is a regulated mechanism for warming the CNS.},

Duration of the exercise and pause periods, ratio of exercise to pause, and speed during the exercise period were varied to determine the effect on performance. Crabs fatigued after 7.5 min of continuous running, a distance capacity (i.e., total distance traveled before fatigue) of 135 m. When the task was done intermittently with 2-min exercise and 2-min pause periods, the crabs fatigued after 87 min (a total distance of 787 m), representing an 5.8-fold increase in distance capacity compared with continuous exercise at the same absolute speed (0.30 m/s) and a 2.2-fold increase in distance capacity compared with continuous exercise at the same average speed (0.15 m/s). Pause periods less than 30 s did not result in greater distance capacity compared with continuous exercise at the same average speed. Longer (3-5 min) and shorter exercise periods (less than or equal to 30 s) decreased distance capacity. Leg muscle lactate increased 10-fold to 15 mumol/g leg during intermittent exercise.

One example of this requirement for context-dependent filtering of a sensory stream is the role that optic flow plays in guiding locomotion. Flying animals, which do not have access to a direct measure of ground speed, rely on optic flow to regulate their forward velocity. This observation suggests that progressive optic flow, the pattern of front-to-back motion on the retina created by forward motion, should be especially salient to an animal while it is in flight, but less important while it is standing still. We recorded the activity of cells in the central complex of Drosophila melanogaster during quiescence and tethered flight using both calcium imaging and whole cell patch-clamp techniques. We observed a genetically identified set of neurons in the fan-shaped body that are unresponsive to visual motion while the animal is quiescent. During flight their baseline activity increases, and they respond to front-to-back motion with changes relative to this baseline. The results provide an example of how nervous systems selectively respond to complex sensory stimuli depending on the current behavioral state of the animal. \textcopyright{} 2014 the American Physiological Society.},

  abstract = {Learning allows animals to respond to changes in their environment within their lifespan. However, many responses to the environment are innate, and need not be learned. Depending on the level of cognitive flexibility an animal shows, such responses can either be modified by learning or not. Many ants deposit pheromone trails to resources, and innately follow such trails. Here, we investigated cognitive flexibility in the ant Lasius niger by asking whether ants can overcome their innate tendency and learn to avoid conspecific pheromone trails when these predict a negative stimulus. Ants were allowed to repeatedly visit a Y-maze, one arm of which was marked with a strong but realistic pheromone trail and led to a punishment (electric shock and/or quinine solution), and the other arm of which was unmarked and led to a 1\hspace{0.25em}mol\hspace{0.25em}l-1 sucrose reward. After ca. 10 trials, ants stopped relying on the pheromone trail, but even after 25 exposures they failed to improve beyond chance levels. However, the ants did not choose randomly: rather, most ants began to favour just one side of the Y-maze, a strategy which resulted in more efficient food retrieval over time, when compared with the first visits. Even when trained in a go/no-go paradigm which precludes side bias development, ants failed to learn to avoid a pheromone trail. These results show rapid learning flexibility towards an innate social signal, but also demonstrate a rarely seen hard limit to this flexibility.},

We highlight MARGO's ability to coordinate tracking and hardware control with two custom behavioral assays (measuring phototaxis and optomotor response) and one optogenetic operant conditioning assay.

Some foundational studies of the mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae (Hopkins) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), documented a diurnal emergence rhythm that was asynchronous with maximum daily temperatures in the field and persisted under constant temperature and light conditions. In the 1970s, researchers hypothesised that this emergence rhythm was regulated by an endogenous circadian mechanism. Reflecting upon these historical data, we consider that a diurnal pattern of D. ponderosae emergence may result from photoperiodic entrainment of the circadian clock during the immature stages. Mechanistically, we suggest that the long-wavelength-sensitive opsin that we previously found to be expressed across D. ponderosae life stages could mediate, from beneath the bark, the input of light\textendash dark cycle cues that are usually required for entrainment of the insect circadian clock.},

Animals exhibit a remarkably wide spectrum of seasonal adaptations, which can include annual cycles of growth, immune function, sexual behaviour, fattening/weight loss, hair growth/loss, thermogenesis, sleep, and hibernation. Annual changes in day length (photoperiod) are a highly predictive signal that can be reliably used to activate a seasonal adaptive programme at the correct time of year. These cycles of physiology also persist in constant conditions revealing an innate long-term timer synchronised by photoperiod, which allows reliable anticipation of forthcoming environmental changes (`circannual clock'). The adaptive value of an innate timer long-term timer is best understood when considering that hibernators and species living at high latitudes, which still have to progress through their seasonal life history despite the absence of a light dark cycle for periods of the year. Calendar time is of vital importance for organisms living in seasonal environments, and, unlike circadian time, the fundamental mechanisms through which organisms maintain an internal sense of calendar time remain unknown. The aim of this review is to present the recent advances in the field, consider the species comparative aspects, discuss non-photoperiodic effects on seasonal rhythms and indicate future directions for the field.},

  abstract = {Most animals have organs that sense gravity. These organs use dense stones (called otoliths or statoconia), which rest on the sensitive hairs of specialized gravity- and motion-sensing cells. The weight of the stones bends the hairs in the direction of gravitational pull. The cells in turn send a coded representation of the gravity or motion stimulus to the central nervous system. Previous experiments, in which the eggs or larvae of a marine mollusk (Aplysia californica, the sea hare) were raised on a centrifuge, demonstrated that the size of the stones (or test mass) was reduced in a graded manner as the gravity field was increased. This suggests that some control mechanism was acting to normalize the weight of the stones. The experiments described here were designed to test the hypothesis that, during their initial development, the mass of the stones is regulated to achieve a desired weight. If this is the case, we would expect a larger-than-normal otolith would develop in animals reared in the weightlessness of space. To test this, freshwater snails and swordtail fish were studied after spaceflight. The snails mated in space, and the stones (statoconia) in their statocysts developed in microgravity. Pre-mated adult female swordtail fish were flown on the Space Shuttle, and the developing larvae were collected after landing. Juvenile fish, where the larval development had taken place on the ground, were also flown. In snails that developed in space, the total volume of statoconia forming the test mass was 50\% greater than in size-matched snails reared in functionally identical equipment on the ground. In the swordtail fish, the size of otoliths was compared between ground- and flight-reared larvae of the same size. For later-stage larvae, the growth of the otolith was significantly greater in the flight-reared fish. However, juvenile fish showed no significant difference in otolith size between flight- and ground-reared fish. Thus, it appears that fish and snails reared in space do produce larger-than-normal otoliths (or their analogs), apparently in an attempt to compensate for the reduced weight of the stones in space. The fish data suggest that there is a critical period during which altered gravity can affect the size of the test mass, since the larval, but not the juvenile, fish showed the changes.},

Probability of transitioning to an active state, P(Wake), measures sleep depth while probability of transitioning to an inactive state, P(Doze), measures sleep pressure. In vivo and computational analyses show that P(Wake) and P(Doze) are independent and control the amount of total sleep. Importantly, we demonstrate that these probabilities are tied to specific biological processes. Genetic and environmental perturbations demonstrate that a given amount of sleep can be produced by many combinations of underlying P(Wake) and P(Doze). We show that measuring sleep pressure and depth continuously, without disturbing on-going behavior, provides greater mechanistic insight into behavior than measuring the amount of sleep alone.},

  abstract = {Genetic analyses of permafrost and temperate sediments reveal that plant and animal DNA may be preserved for long periods, even in the absence of obvious macrofossils. In Siberia, five permafrost cores ranging from 400,000 to 10,000 years old contained at least 19 different plant taxa, including the oldest authenticated ancient DNA sequences known, and megafaunal sequences including mammoth, bison, and horse. The genetic data record a number of dramatic changes in the taxonomic diversity and composition of Beringian vegetation and fauna. Temperate cave sediments in New Zealand also yielded DNA sequences of extinct biota, including two species of ratite moa, and 29 plant taxa characteristic of the prehuman environment. Therefore, many sedimentary deposits may contain unique, and widespread, genetic records of paleoenvironments.},

  abstract = {1. The carabid fauna of woodland is more abundant and more varied than that of open country, and this is associated with the litter layer characteristic of woods. 2. Open ground has fewer carnivorous and more herbivorous ground beetles than woodland, and the herbivores are strongly diurnal. 3. Nebria brevicollis is an autumn breeder and is strictly nocturnal as late larva and adult. 4. The common species of Notiophilus in woodland are all spring breeders and are diurnal as larvae and adults. 5. Feronia madida is nocturnal in woodland and mainly diurnal in open grassland. Experimental investigation shows it to have an intrinsic 24 h rhythm with its active phase at night, but the time of movement can be controlled by manipulating the periodicity of feeding and of light. Periodicity which has been induced in this way rapidly fades in continuous darkness. 6. The bearing of these findings on the balance of nocturnal and diurnal activity in different habitats is discussed.},

  abstract = {Circadian regulation of the amplitude of the electroretinogram (ERG) of the cockroach Leucophaea maderae was investigated. Two components of the ERG exhibited circadian rhythms in amplitude. Interestingly, the peak amplitudes for the two rhythms were approximately 12 hr out of phase. The dominant corneal negative potential (the "sustained component") exhibited maximum amplitude during the subjective night. A second corneal negative potential (the "off-transient") was at a maximum during the subjective day. Intensity-response curves of the sustained component were measured at both the peak and trough of the rhythm. The results showed that the circadian rhythm in amplitude reflected a sensitivity change equivalent to 0.2-0.6 log unit of intensity. An effort was also made to identify the anatomical locus of the pacemaking oscillator for the ERG rhythm in a series of lesion experiments. Neural isolation of the optic lobe from the midbrain by bisection of the optic lobe proximal to the distal edge of the lobula had no effect on the circadian rhythm of ERG amplitude. Bisection of the optic lobe distal to the lobula abolished the ERG amplitude rhythm. These results suggest that the pacemaker is located in the optic lobe near the lobula; that its motion continues in the absence of neural connections with the rest of the nervous system; and that its regulation of ERG amplitude depends on neural pathways in the optic lobe.},

Efforts to understand the links between evolutionary and ecological dynamics hinge on our ability to measure and understand how genes influence phenotypes, fitness and population dynamics. Quantitative genetics provides a range of theoretical and empirical tools with which to achieve this when the relatedness between individuals within a population is known. 2. A number of recent studies have used a type of mixed-effects model, known as the animal model, to estimate the genetic component of phenotypic variation using data collected in the field. Here, we provide a practical guide for ecologists interested in exploring the potential to apply this quantitative genetic method in their research. 3. We begin by outlining, in simple terms, key concepts in quantitative genetics and how an animal model estimates relevant quantitative genetic parameters, such as heritabilities or genetic correlations. 4. We then provide three detailed example tutorials, for implementation in a variety of software packages, for some basic applications of the animal model. We discuss several important statistical issues relating to best practice when fitting different kinds of mixed models. 5. We conclude by briefly summarizing more complex applications of the animal model, and by highlighting key pitfalls and dangers for the researcher wanting to begin using quantitative genetic tools to address ecological and evolutionary questions.},

Here we present an analysis of the major steps in ant evolution, based for the first time, to our knowledge, on combined recent advances in paleontology, phylogeny, and the study of contemporary life histories. We provide evidence of the causal forces of natural selection shaping several key phenomena: (i) the relative lateness and rarity in geological time of the emergence of eusociality in ants and other animal phylads; (ii) the prevalence of monogamy at the time of evolutionary origin; and (iii) the female-biased sex allocation observed in many ant species. We argue that a clear understanding of the evolution of social insects can emerge if, in addition to relatedness-based arguments, we take into account key factors of natural history and study how natural selection acts on alleles that modify social behavior.},

Directional information is provided by a celestial compass, whereas distance measurement is accomplished by a stride integrator, or pedometer. Here we examine the recently demonstrated pedometer function in more detail. By manipulating leg lengths in foraging desert ants we could also change their stride lengths. Ants with elongated legs ('stilts') or shortened legs ('stumps') take larger or shorter strides, respectively, and misgauge travel distance. Travel distance is overestimated by experimental animals walking on stilts, and underestimated by animals walking on stumps - strongly indicative of stride integrator function in distance measurement. High-speed video analysis was used to examine the actual changes in stride length, stride frequency and walking speed caused by the manipulations of leg length. Unexpectedly, quantitative characteristics of walking behaviour remained almost unaffected by imposed changes in leg length, demonstrating remarkable robustness of leg coordination and walking performance. These data further allowed normalisation of homing distances displayed by manipulated animals with regard to scaling and speed effects. The predicted changes in homing distance are in quantitative agreement with the experimental data, further supporting the pedometer hypothesis.},

With the present experiments we attempt to interfere with both, stride integration and optic flow input in order to reveal possible interactions of the two modes of odometry and further functional details of the stride integrator.We tried to impair stride integration by amputating two of the six walking legs. Amputation of left middle and right hind legs had especially severe effects since it left only the right front leg in one of the support tripods that are alternately used in walking. We tried to impair optic flow input - which is used for distance estimation to a minor extent - by covering both ventral eye halves. These two sets of manipulations were carried out in combination to study possible compensatory effects, for instance, of optic flow input in the case of an impaired stride integrator.Unexpectedly, none of the manipulations we carried out had significant effects on homing performance. This was true with regard to homing distance estimation (as determined by the centres of the ants' nest searches) and homing certainty (as determined by the search spreads). These results corroborate the surprising robustness of odometry by stride integration, and they indicate that leg proprioceptive feedback is used for stride integration. The question of a possible interaction of optic flow input and stride integration remains open. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

They do so by integrating courses steered and the distances travelled into a continually updated home vector. While it is known that the angular orientation is based on skylight cues, it still is largely enigmatic how the ants measure distances travelled. We extended the ants' task into the third dimension by training them to walk within an array of uphill and downhill channels, and later testing them on flat terrain, or vice versa. In these tests the ants indicated homing distances that did not correspond to the distances actually travelled, but to the ground distances; that is, to the sum of the horizontal projections of the uphill and downhill segments of the ants' paths. These results suggest a much more sophisticated mechanism of distance estimation than hitherto thought. The ants must be able to measure the slopes of undulating terrain and to integrate this information into their "odometer" for the distance estimation process.},

  abstract = {1. Researchers frequently take repeated measurements of individuals in a sample with the goal of quantifying the proportion of the total variation that can be attributed to variation among individuals vs. variation among measurements within individuals. The proportion of the variation attributed to variation among individuals is known as repeatability and is most frequently estimated as the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The goal of our study is to provide guidelines for determining the sample size (number of individuals and number of measurements per individual) required to accurately estimate the ICC. 2. We report a range of ICCs from the literature and estimate 95\% confidence intervals for these estimates. We introduce a predictive equation derived by Bonett (2002), and we test the assumptions of this equation through simulation. Finally, we create an R statistical package for the planning of experiments and estimation of ICCs. 3. Repeatability estimates were reported in 1{$\cdot$}5\% of the articles published in the journals surveyed. Repeatabilities tended to be highest when the ICC was used to estimate measurement error and lowest when it was used to estimate repeatability of behavioural and physiological traits. Few authors report confidence intervals, but our estimated 95\% confidence intervals for published ICCs generally indicated a low level of precision associated with these estimates. This survey demonstrates the need for a protocol to estimate repeatability. 4. Analysis of the predictions from Bonett's equation over a range of sample sizes, expected repeatabilities and desired confidence interval widths yields both analytical and intuitive guidelines for designing experiments to estimate repeatability. However, we find a tendency for the confidence interval to be underestimated by the equation when ICCs are high and overestimated when ICCs and the number of measurements per individual are low. 5. The sample size to use when estimating repeatability is a question pitting investigator effort against expected precision of the estimate. We offer guidelines that apply over a wide variety of ecological and evolutionary studies estimating repeatability, measurement error or heritability. Additionally, we provide the R package, icc, to facilitate analyses and determine the most economic use of resources when planning experiments to estimate repeatability.},

As old as navigation is in the animal kingdom, as diverse are its mechanisms and implementations, depending on an organism's ecology and its endowment with sensors and actuators. The use of landmarks for piloting or the use of trail pheromones for route following have been examined in great detail and in a variety of animal species. The same is true for senses of direction--the compasses for navigation--and the construction of vectors for navigation from compass and distance cues. The measurement of distance itself--odometry--has received much less attention. The present review addresses some recent progress in the understanding of odometers in invertebrates, after outlining general principles of navigation to put odometry in its proper context. Finally, a number of refinements that increase navigation accuracy and safety are addressed.},

  abstract = {Complex tasks like hunting moving prey in an unpredictable environment require high levels of motor and sensory integration. An animal needs to detect and track suitable prey objects, measure their distance and orientation relative to its own position, and finally produce the correct motor output to approach and capture the prey. In the insect brain, the central complex (CX) is one target area where integration is likely to take place. In this study, we performed extracellular multi-unit recordings on the CX of freely hunting praying mantises (Tenodera sinensis). Initially, we recorded the neural activity of freely moving mantises as they hunted live prey. The recordings showed activity in cells that either reflected the mantis's own movements or the actions of a prey individual, which the mantises focused on. In the latter case, the activity increased as the prey moved and decreased when it stopped. Interestingly, cells ignored the movement of the other prey than the one to which the mantis attended. To obtain quantitative data, we generated simulated prey targets presented on an LCD screen positioned below the clear floor of the arena. The simulated target oscillated back and forth at various angles and distances. We identified populations of cells whose activity patterns were strongly linked to the appearance, movement, and relative position of the virtual prey. We refer to these as sensory responses. We also found cells whose activity preceded orientation movement toward the prey. We call these motor responses. Some cells showed both sensory and motor properties. Stimulation through tetrodes in some of the preparations could also generate similar movements. These results suggest the crucial importance of the CX to prey-capture behavior in predatory insects like the praying mantis and, hence, further emphasize its role in behaviorally and ecologically relevant contexts.},

Observed differences between small and large teams are magnified for higher-impact work, with small teams known for disruptive~work and large teams for developing work. Differences in topic and research design account for a small part of the relationship between team size and disruption; most of the effect occurs at the level of the individual, as people move between smaller and larger teams. These results demonstrate that both small and large teams are essential to a flourishing ecology of science and technology, and suggest that, to achieve this, science policies should aim to support a diversity of team sizes.},

  abstract = {Advances in electrophysiological experiments have led to the discovery of mechanosensitive ion channels (MSCs) and the identification of the physiological function of specific MSCs. They are believed to play important roles in mechanosensitive pathways by allowing for cells to sense their mechanical environment. However, the physiological function of many MSCs has not been conclusively identified. Therefore, experiments have been developed that expose cells to various mechanical loads, such as shear flow, membrane indentation, osmotic challenges and hydrostatic pressure. In line with these experiments, mechanical unloading, as experienced in microgravity, represents an interesting alternative condition, since exposure to microgravity leads to a series of physiological adaption processes. As outlined in this review, electrophysiological experiments performed in microgravity have shown an influence of gravity on biological functions depending on ion channels at all hierarchical levels, from the cellular level to organs. In this context, calcium signaling represents an interesting cellular pathway, as it involves the direct action of calcium-permeable ion channels, and specific gravitatic cells have linked graviperception to this pathway. Multiple key proteins in the graviperception pathways have been identified. However, measurements on vertebrae cells have revealed controversial results. In conclusion, electrophysiological experiments in microgravity have shown that ion-channel-dependent physiological processes are altered in mechanically unloaded conditions. Future experiments may provide a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Historic yield advances in the major crops have, to a large extent, been achieved by selection for improved productivity of groups of plant individuals such as high-density stands. Research suggests that such improved group productivity depends on ``cooperative'' traits (e.g., erect leaves, short stems) that\textemdash while beneficial to the group\textemdash decrease individual fitness under competition. This poses a problem for some traditional breeding approaches, especially when selection occurs at the level of individuals, because ``selfish'' traits will be selected for and reduce yield in high-density monocultures. One approach, therefore, has been to select individuals based on ideotypes with traits expected to promote group productivity. However, this approach is limited to architectural and physiological traits whose effects on growth and competition are relatively easy to anticipate. Here, we developed a general and simple method for the discovery of alleles promoting cooperation in plant stands. Our method is based on the game-theoretical premise that alleles increasing cooperation benefit the monoculture group but are disadvantageous to the individual when facing noncooperative neighbors. Testing the approach using the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, we found a major effect locus where the rarer allele was associated with increased cooperation and productivity in high-density stands. The allele likely affects a pleiotropic gene, since we find that it is also associated with reduced root competition but higher resistance against disease. Thus, even though cooperation is considered evolutionarily unstable except under special circumstances, conflicting selective forces acting on a pleiotropic gene might maintain latent genetic variation for cooperation in nature. Such variation, once identified in a crop, could rapidly be leveraged in modern breeding programs and provide efficient routes to increase yields.},

  abstract = {In frequentisi inference, we commonly use a single point (point estimator) or an interval (confidence interval/"interval estimator") to estimate a parameter of interest. A very simple question is: Can we also use a distribution function ("distribution estimator") to estimate a parameter of interest in frequentisi inference in the style of a Bayesian posterior? The answer is affirmative, and confidence distribution is a natural choice of such a "distribution estimator". The concept of a confidence distribution has a long history, and its interpretation has long been fused with fiducial inference. Historically, it has been misconstrued as a fiducial concept, and has not been fully developed in the frequentist framework. In recent years, confidence distribution has attracted a surge of renewed attention, and several developments have highlighted its promising potential as an effective inferential tool. This article reviews recent developments of confidence distributions, along with a modern definition and interpretation of the concept. It includes distributional inference based on confidence distributions and its extensions, optimality issues and their applications. Based on the new developments, the concept of a confidence distribution subsumes and unifies a wide range of examples, from regular parametric (fiducial distribution) examples to bootstrap distributions, significance (p-value) functions, normalized likelihood functions, and, in some cases, Bayesian priors and posteriors. The discussion is entirely within the school of frequentist inference, with emphasis on applications providing useful statistical inference tools for problems where frequentist methods with good properties were previously unavailable or could not be easily obtained. Although it also draws attention to some of the differences and similarities among frequentist, fiducial and Bayesian approaches, the review is not intended to re-open the philosophical debate that has lasted more than two hundred years. On the contrary, it is hoped that the article will help bridge the gaps between these different statistical procedures. II est courant, en inference fr\'equentielle, d'utiliser un point unique (une estimation ponctuelle) ou un intervalle (intervalle de confiance) dans le but d'estimer un param\`etre d'int\'er\^et. Une question tr\`es simple se pose: peut-on \'egalement utiliser, dans le m\^eme but, et dans la m\^eme optique fr\'equentielle, \`a la fa\c{c}on dont les Bay\'esiens utilisent une loi a posteriori, une distribution de probabilit\'e? La r\'eponse est affirmative, et les distributions de confiance apparaissent comme un choix naturel dans ce contexte. Le concept de distribution de confiance a une longue histoire, longtemps associ\'ee, \`a tort, aux th\'eories d'inf\'erence fiducielle, ce qui a compromis son d\'eveloppement dans l'optique fr\'equentielle. Les distributions de confiance ont r\'ecemment attir\'e un regain d'int\'er\^et, et plusieurs r\'esultats ont mis en \'evidence leur potentiel consid\'erable en tant qu'outil inf\'erentiel. Cet article pr\'esente une d\'efinition moderne du concept, et examine les ses \'evolutions r\'ecentes. Il aborde les m\'ethodes d'inf\'erence, les probl\`emes d'optimalit\'e, et les applications. A la lumi\`ere de ces nouveaux d\'eveloppements, le concept de distribution de confiance englobe et unifie un large \'eventail de cas particuliers, depuis les exemples param\'etriques r\'eguliers (distributions fiducielles), les lois de r\'e\'echantillonnage, les p-valeurs et les fonctions de vraisemblance normalis\'ees jusqu'aux a priori et posteriori bay\'esiens. La discussion est enti\`erement men\'ee d'un point de vue frequentici, et met l'accent sur les applications dans lesquelles les solutions fr\'equentielles sont inexistantes ou d'une application difficile. Bien que nous attirions \'egalement l'attention sur les similitudes et les diff\'erences que pr\'esentent les approches fr\'equentielle, fiducielle, et Bay\'esienne, notre intention n'est pas de rouvrir un d\'ebat philosophique qui dure depuis pr\`es de deux cents ans. Nous esp\'erons bien au contraire contribuer \`a combler le foss\'e qui existe entre les diff\'erents points de vue.},

However, most previous studies were based on qualitative or semi-quantitative characterizations. Here we quantified sleep in flies. We set up an assay to continuously track the activity of flies using infrared camera, which monitored the movement of tens of flies simultaneously with high spatial and temporal resolution. We obtained accurate statistics regarding the rest and sleep patterns of single flies. Analysis of our data has revealed a general pattern of rest and sleep: the rest statistics obeyed a power law distribution and the sleep statistics obeyed an exponential distribution. Thus, a resting fly would start to move again with a probability that decreased with the time it has rested, whereas a sleeping fly would wake up with a probability independent of how long it had slept. Resting transits to sleeping at time scales of minutes. Our method allows quantitative investigations of resting and sleeping behaviors and our results provide insights for mechanisms of falling into and waking up from sleep.},

While these phenomena are well described in vertebrates, it is unclear if invertebrates have distinct sleep stages. We perform local field potential (LFP) recordings on flies spontaneously sleeping, and compare their brain activity to flies induced to sleep using either genetic activation of sleep-promoting circuitry or the GABAA agonist Gaboxadol. We find a transitional sleep stage associated with a 7\textendash 10\,Hz oscillation in the central brain during spontaneous sleep. Oscillatory activity is also evident when we acutely activate sleep-promoting neurons in the dorsal fan-shaped body (dFB) of Drosophila. In contrast, sleep following Gaboxadol exposure is characterized by low-amplitude LFPs, during which dFB-induced effects are suppressed. Sleep in flies thus appears to involve at least two distinct stages: increased oscillatory activity, particularly during sleep induction, followed by desynchronized or decreased brain activity.},

Yet, despite the frequent occurrence of sexual dimorphisms in morphology and behaviour, few studies have assessed whether and how sexes differ in metabolic trait covariances. Methods We investigated sex-specific relationships among resting or active metabolic rate (RMR and AMR, respectively) with exploratory behaviour, measured independently of metabolic rate in a novel environment, body size and body mass, in Carabus hortensis ground beetles. Results RMR, AMR and exploratory behaviour were repeatable among individuals across time, except for male RMR which was unrepeatable. Female RMR neither correlated with exploratory behaviour nor body size/body mass. In contrast, AMR was correlated with both body size and exploratory behaviour. Males with larger body sizes had higher AMR, whereas females with larger body sizes had lower AMR. Both male and female AMR were significantly related to exploratory behaviour, though the relationships between AMR and exploration were body mass-dependent in males and temperature-dependent in females. Discussion Differences between sexes exist in the covariances between metabolic rate, body size and exploratory behaviour. This suggests that selection acts differently on males and females to produce these trait covariances with potentially important consequences for individual fitness.},

  abstract = {The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, shows a clear circadian locomotor rhythm in light cycles and constant darkness. Although the rhythm disappears in constant light, we found that temperature cycles drive the circadian rhythm both in locomotor activity and molecular abundance of PERIOD (PER) and TIMELESS (TIM). The thermoperiodically induced locomotor rhythm entailed an anticipatory activity at the late thermophase, which required several transient cycles to establish a steady-state entrainment, suggesting that the rhythm is endogenous and driven by a circadian clock. Western blot analysis revealed that PER and TIM increased during the cryophase, peaking at the middle to late cryophase. PER was also cyclically expressed under the temperature cycle in the known per-expressing neurons, i.e. so-called lateral (LNs) and dorsal neurons (DNs), and two pairs of cells (LPNs) that were located in the lateral posterior protocerebrum. It is thus suggested that the temperature cycle induces the cycling of PER and TIM either by blocking somewhere in the photic entrainment pathway during the cryophase or temporally activating their translation to sufficient protein levels to drive a circadian oscillation. In flies lacking pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) or PDF-expressing cells, the anticipatory activity was relatively dispersed. disco(2) mutant flies lacking the lateral neurons still showed an anticipatory activity, but with dispersed activity. These behavioural results suggest that not only LNs but also DNs and LPNs can, at least, partially participate in regulating the thermoperiodically induced rhythm.},

  abstract = {The direct linear transformation (DLT) method [Abdel-Aziz and Karara, APS Symposium on Photogrammetry. American Society of Photogrammetry, Falls Church, VA (1971)] is widely used in biomechanics to obtain three-dimensional space coordinates from film and video records. This method has some major shortcomings when used to analyze events which take place over large areas. To overcome these shortcomings, a three-dimensional data collection method based on the DLT method, and making use of panning cameras, was developed. Several small single control volumes were combined to construct a large total control volume. For each single control volume, a regression equation (calibration equation) is developed to express each of the 11 DLT parameters as a function of camera orientation, so that the DLT parameters can then be estimated from arbitrary camera orientations. Once the DLT parameters are known for at least two cameras, and the associated two-dimensional film or video coordinates of the event are obtained, the desired three-dimensional space coordinates can be computed. In a laboratory test, five single control volumes (in a total control volume of 24.40 \texttimes{} 2.44 \texttimes{} 2.44 m3) were used to test the effect of the position of the single control volume on the accuracy of the computed three dimensional space coordinates. Linear and quadratic calibration equations were used to test the effect of the order of the equation on the accuracy of the computed three dimensional space coordinates. For four of the five single control volumes tested, the mean resultant errors associated with the use of the linear calibration equation were significantly larger than those associated with the use of the quadratic calibration equation. The position of the single control volume had no significant effect on the mean resultant errors in computed three dimensional coordinates when the quadratic calibration equation was used. Under the same data collection conditions, the mean resultant errors in the computed three dimensional coordinates associated with the panning and stationary DLT methods were 17 and 22 mm, respectively. The major advantages of the panning DLT method lie in the large image sizes obtained and in the ease with which the data can be collected. The method also has potential for use in a wide variety of contexts. The major shortcoming of the method is the large amount of digitizing necessary to calibrate the total control volume. Adaptations of the method to reduce the amount of digitizing required are being explored. \textcopyright{} 1993.},

Kinematic data were collected for four elite male triple jumpers. It was found that the loss in the horizontal velocity during a support phase has a significant positive linear correlation with the gain in the vertical velocity during the same support phase.

The optimization results showed that there was an optimum phase ratio for the longest actual distance for each triple jumper. The results of a validity test showed that the model predicted the actual distance with a degree of fair accuracy. The results of sensitivity analysis showed that the optimum phase ratio for a given athlete was a function of the horizontal-to-vertical velocity conversion factor and the horizontal velocity at the touchdown of the hop.

Across animals, anesthesia endpoints such as loss of responsiveness or immobility appear to require significantly different drug concentrations. A closer examination in key model organisms such as the mouse, fly, or the worm, uncovers a trend: more complex behaviors, either requiring several sub-behaviors, or multiple neural circuits working together, are more sensitive to volatile general anesthetics. This trend is also evident when measuring neural correlates of general anesthesia. Here, we review this complexity hypothesis in humans and model organisms, and attempt to reconcile these findings with the more recent view that general anesthetics potentiate endogenous sleep pathways in most animals. Finally, we propose a presynaptic mechanism, and thus an explanation for how these drugs might compromise a succession of brain functions of increasing complexity.},

While ladybirds exhibit a strong rotational optomotor reflex, any visual control of speed there might be was found to be too feeble to be biologically significant. To see whether walking speed is instead controlled proprioceptively, changes in speed were measured when ladybirds pulled small weights. But there was no evidence of proprioceptive control either. Flying and swimming insects, on the other hand, do use visual feedback to control their translational velocity, and, unlike walking insects, must do so to cope with winds or watercurrents.}

  abstract = {We caught solitary foragers of the Australian Jack Jumper ant, Myrmecia croslandi, and released them in three compass directions at distances of 10 and 15 m from the nest at locations they have never been before. We recorded the head orientation and the movements of ants within a radius of 20 cm from the release point and, in some cases, tracked their subsequent paths with a differential GPS. We find that upon surfacing from their transport vials onto a release platform, most ants move into the home direction after looking around briefly. The ants use a systematic scanning procedure, consisting of saccadic head and body rotations that sweep gaze across the scene with an average angular velocity of 90\textdegree{} s-1 and intermittent changes in turning direction. By mapping the ants' gaze directions onto the local panorama, we find that neither the ants' gaze nor their decisions to change turning direction are clearly associated with salient or significant features in the scene. Instead, the ants look most frequently in the home direction and start walking fast when doing so. Displaced ants can thus identify home direction with little translation, but exclusively through rotational scanning. We discuss the navigational information content of the ants' habitat and how the insects' behaviour informs us about how they may acquire and retrieve that information. \textcopyright{} 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

We leverage three self-supervisionary signals in multiview tracking to utilize the unlabeled data: (1) a keypoint in one view can be supervised by other views via epipolar geometry; (2) a keypoint detection must be consistent across time; (3) a visible keypoint in one view is likely to be visible in the adjacent view. We design a new end-to-end network that can propagate these self-supervisionary signals across the unlabeled data from the labeled data in a differentiable manner. We show that our approach outperforms existing detectors including DeepLabCut tailored to the keypoint detection of non-human species such as monkeys, dogs, and mice.},

  abstract = {Neuronal circuits are hallmarks of complex decision making processes in the animal world. How animals without neurons process information and respond to environmental cues promises a new window into studying precursors of neuronal control and origin of the nervous system as we know it today. Robust decision making in animals, such as in chemotaxis or thermotaxis, often requires internal symmetry breaking (such as A-P axis) provided naturally by a given body plan of an animal. Here we report the discovery of robust thermotaxis behavior in Trichoplax adhaerens, an early divergent, enigmatic animal with no anterior-posterior symmetry breaking (apolar), and no known neurons or muscles. We present the first quantitative and robust behavioral response assay in placozoan, which present an apolar flat geometry. By exposing T. adhaerens to a thermal gradient under a long-term imaging setup, we observe robust thermotaxis that occurs over timescale of hours, independent of any circadian rhythms. We quantify that T. adhaerens can detect thermal gradients of at least 0.1 \textdegree C/cm. Positive thermotaxis is observed for a range of baseline temperatures from 17-22.5 \textdegree C with motility trajectories to be well-described by a Levy distribution. Interestingly, the organism does not maintain a fixed orientation while performing thermotaxis. Utilizing natural diversity in size of adult organisms (100um to a few mm), we also demonstrate a critical animal size above which thermotaxis behavior is hindered. Several TRP family homologs have been previously reported to be conserved in metazoans, including in T. adhaerens. We discover naringenin, a known TRPM3 antagonist, inhibits thermotaxis in T. adhaerens . The discovery of robust thermotaxis in T. adhaerens provides a tractable handle to interrogate information processing in a brainless animal. Understanding how divergent marine animals process thermal cues is also critical due to rapid temperature rise in our oceans.},

Subsequent multivariate analyses of footfall positions and walking kinematics revealed a set of constant features characterizing ant locomotion. The alternating tripod gait prevails over a wide range of speeds. The temporal rigidity of tripod coordination is paralleled by spatially rigid footfall patterns. Tripod geometry is preserved irrespective of speed and curvature. When walking around curves, tripods are rotated relative to the walking trajectory. Whereas stride length on the inner side of the curve is shortened, that on the outer side is independent of curvature.},

  abstract = {This study examines the effects of body size variation on the optical properties of the compound eyes of visually guided desert ants belonging to the genus Cataglyphis. Although linear head size may vary by a factor of 2 within conspecific workers and most optical parameters change accordingly, the extent of the visual field remains constant. Comparative measurements carried out on workers of three species (C. albicans, C. bicolor and C. fortis) and on reproductive females and males of one species (C. bicolor) show that the form (size and shape) of the visual field is highly characteristic for each caste/species. A constant visual field is realised by reciprocal scaling rules for the number of ommatidia and the angular spacing of ommatidia. While larger ants have more ommatidia per compound eye, interommatidial angles are reduced accordingly, thus giving rise to a constant visual field. Among conspecific ant workers, the relationship between spatial visual acuity and eye size is similar to that found in interspecific comparisons and reflects optical constraints imposed on the design of the compound eye. Mapping of spatial visual directions onto the compound eye surface reveals a characteristic, inhomogeneous distribution of interommatidial spacing, particularly a foveal band with increased visual acuity in the vertical direction. This 'visual stretch' viewing the horizon is similar to that found in a variety of flying insects. Although, among conspecific workers, both the number of ommatidia and the interommatidial angles vary with varying head size, the overall pattern of interommatidial spacing is maintained so that corresponding positions on the compound eye of small and large individuals look in equivalent directions in space. These findings are in accordance with the observation that the shape of the compound eye surface, as expressed by the radius of curvature along cross sections, is similar in small and large ants.},

  abstract = {Biologists determine experimental effects by perturbing biological entities or units. When done appropriately, independent replication of the entity\textendash intervention pair contributes to the sample size (N) and forms the basis of statistical inference. If the wrong entity\textendash intervention pair is chosen, an experiment cannot address the question of interest. We surveyed a random sample of published animal experiments from 2011 to 2016 where interventions were applied to parents and effects examined in the offspring, as regulatory authorities provide clear guidelines on replication with such designs. We found that only 22\% of studies (95\% CI = 17\%\textendash 29\%) replicated the correct entity\textendash intervention pair and thus made valid statistical inferences. Nearly half of the studies (46\%, 95\% CI = 38\%\textendash 53\%) had pseudoreplication while 32\% (95\% CI = 26\%\textendash 39\%) provided insufficient information to make a judgement. Pseudoreplication artificially inflates the sample size, and thus the evidence for a scientific claim, resulting in false positives. We argue that distinguishing between biological units, experimental units, and observational units clarifies where replication should occur, describe the criteria for genuine replication, and provide concrete examples of in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo experimental designs.}

Recent innovations for statistical analysis of multifaceted interrelated data make obtaining more accurate and meaningful results possible, but key decisions of the analyses to use, and which components to present in a scientific paper or report, may be overwhelming. We offer a 10-step protocol to streamline analysis of data that will enhance understanding of the data, the statistical models and the results, and optimize communication with the reader with respect to both the procedure and the outcomes. The protocol takes the investigator from study design and organization of data (formulating relevant questions, visualizing data collection, data exploration, identifying dependency), through conducting analysis (presenting, fitting and validating the model) and presenting output (numerically and visually), to extending the model via simulation. Each step includes procedures to clarify aspects of the data that affect statistical analysis, as well as guidelines for written presentation. Steps are illustrated with examples using data from the literature. Following this protocol will reduce the organization, analysis and presentation of what may be an overwhelming information avalanche into sequential and, more to the point, manageable, steps. It provides guidelines for selecting optimal statistical tools to assess data relevance and significance, for choosing aspects of the analysis to include in a published report and for clearly communicating information.},
